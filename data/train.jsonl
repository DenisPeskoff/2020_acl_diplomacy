{"messages": ["Germany!\n\nJust the person I want to speak with. I have a somewhat crazy idea that I\u2019ve always wanted to try with I/G, but I\u2019ve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what\u2019s worse, it might make you suspicious of me. \n\nSo...do I suggest it?\n\nI\u2019m thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That\u2019s my hope anyway.\n\nWhat is your appetite like for unusual and crazy?", "You've whet my appetite, Italy. What's the suggestion?", "\ud83d\udc4d", "It seems like there are a lot of ways that could go wrong...I don't see why France would see you approaching/taking Munich--while I do nothing about it--and not immediately feel skittish", "Yeah, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve tried it and it works, cause I\u2019ve never tried it or seen it. But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we\u2019re really at war and you\u2019re going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019ve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I\u2019m not offended or concerned if it\u2019s just not for you. I\u2019m happy to play more conventionally too. Up to you.", "I am just sensing that you don\u2019t like this idea, so shall we talk about something else? That was just a crazy idea I\u2019ve always wanted to try. I\u2019m happy to play more conservatively.", "Any thoughts?", "Sorry Italy I've been away doing, um, German things. Brewing Lagers?", "I don't think I'm ready to go for that idea, however I'd be down for some good ol'-fashioned Austria-kicking?", "I am pretty conflicted about whether to guess that you were telling the truth or lying about the \u201cbrewing lagers\u201d thing. I am going to take it literally and say \ud83d\udc4e even though I don\u2019t think you meant it deceptively. \ud83d\ude09", "But I think I can get over \u201cLagergate\u201d and we can still be friends. \n\nAs of right now, I think Austria may be my most reliable ally. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019d like to play as a Central Trio if you have any interest in that. Thoughts?", "We haven't even passed a season yet and you have a 'most reliable ally'?\n\nI'll consider this proposal but, basically, I'm not going to expose myself to risk from either of you until I've seen a bit of your behavior", "Well, at least I have an idea of who to trust. Obviously, my ideas are subject to change. \n\nI understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance. \n\nIf you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a loyal ally or two that I can coordinate with and make awesome moves with. Makes the game easier and a lot more fun.", "Just an FYI: I\u2019ve now had both England and France suggest to me that I should move to Tyrolia and France will support me to Munich in the Fall. One saying that to me is not a big deal, but with both mentioning it, my alarm bells are going off. I am concerned about an E/F. \n\nI\u2019m certainly not moving to Tyrolia. But I just want you to be cautious here. I feel like England and France are working together.", "I appreciate the tip, but I'm wondering why you're so against ousting me from Munich if I haven't explicitly agreed to be your ally?", "Because it is terrible, terrible play for Italy to attack Germany, in my view. If I were to attack you in Munich, I could never hold Munich. So, all I would be doing is weakening you, and helping France, England, or both to get really big. \n\nI don\u2019t have any long-term path going north. Helping France to take you down is a sucker\u2019s play, whether you are working with me or not.", "Did France tell you he was moving to Burgundy, or was that a stab?", "I was not informed of it, no. And England is leading me to believe it's part of a play for Belgium, so if they're working together this might be a trick...\n\nItaly, you seem like a straight shooter, and Austria has confirmed with me about your two's alliance. So I'll confide in you--this is my first ever game of diplomacy, and I think that teaming up with the two of you could help me learn more and have more fun. So, if you're still interested in a central powers alliance, I'm in.", "Okay full disclosure: I'm not very smart, and I accidentally let slip to England that you told me France was plotting to take Munich. I'm sorry for the error but I figured it was better to admit it so you know that England/France may not trust you.", "Okay, thanks for telling me.", "So, um, no alliance then?", "I do want to be allies. Sorry, busy weekend here running around with bambinos. More to come.", "What would you think of helping me take Marseilles in two turns?", "Hi Germany, I\u2019ll certainly consider that. Though, I\u2019ll note: traditionally, Germany would help Italy to Marseilles if the two of them work together there. The reason is that: if I help you to Marseilles, I\u2019m basically cut off from going west and getting anything myself. So, usually, Germany would help Italy into Marseilles to encourage Italy to come west and Germany would plan to take Paris, Belgium and Brest.", "Fair enough--I'll help you take it, then, but I'll need to deal with Belgium first.", "How are things going with England? I think that getting him to work with you is the main key here.", "I'm trying--I just offered to assist with taking Sweden in exchange for some assistance into Belgium...not sure if they'll go for it...", "I\u2019ll check with England and try to see where his head is at.", "I've actually been thinking about this game all day \ud83d\ude05  and have come up with a plan I like a bit better... but England still hasn't responded to my initial offer.", "That\u2019s the worst!\n\nAnd I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re so focused on this in your first game. It\u2019s a really great game if you put in the time and effort!", "You're definitely telling the truth on that one. So can I count on you to move to piedmont this season?", "I don\u2019t think I can afford to move to Piedmont this season. I don\u2019t really trust Austria to avoid walking through that door if I leave it wide open. \n\nI think you need to get England on board to attack France.", "That's valid. And actually I was conferring with England and we concluded that it's not really gonna be possible for me to help you take Marseilles this year anyway. \n\n...what are you and Austria planning for this year, then? I'm willing to tell you my plans in exchange as a gesture of trust. \n\nHave you communicated at all with England or France?", "Hi, are you there?\n\nJust woke up. \n\nEngland did return my message, but he did not tell me anything substantive so I really don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019m planning to move towards Turkey.", "Well, you\u2019re in trouble. That England move is trouble. \n\nI\u2019m going to try to convince him to change course. I suggest you be very kind to him, and don\u2019t burn that bridge. I think your game hinges on turning England around.", "Hi Germany,\n\nI\u2019m working hard on turning England. And I\u2019m also trying to get Russia to come to your aid. Doing the best I can! I\u2019ll keep you posted.", "England just told me that Russia is helping them to take Denmark so that may be a lost cause. Granted, the source for that intel is a serpentine jackal-spawn", "Okay, I\u2019m reasonably sure that England wants to take the Channel and attack France now. \n\nI believe that you should basically do whatever England asks to help make this happen. As long as E attacks F, you will be in a much better position, and you\u2019ll gain back centers quickly. \n\nWhat are you hearing?", "What are your plans for this turn? I can't help but notice that Munich is surrounded by foreign armies on three sides...\n\nI wish I could be more helpful but I'm pretty much just treading water right now trying not to lose anything else", "Hey \u2014 sorry, just getting back into this now.", "I have good news! (1) I am finally attacking France this turn. (2) I will be supporting Munich to hold from Tyrolia. \n\nLet\u2019s turn this game around, yes?", "I am pretty sure that England is not attacking you this turn. And I am committed to supporting Munich holding. Make sure you don\u2019t move Munich so that it can take my support.", "Okay, can do. Thanks!", "I suggest that you order:\nKiel Support Berlin holding\nBerlin Support Munich holding\nHelg to Holland\nMunich Support Berlin holding", "I agree completely--although I didn't know that a country could hold *and* support at the same time! Thanks!", "Thanks Italy. Hope you're enjoying the weather on the Anatolian \ud83d\ude09", "I will be supporting Munich to hold again. And I\u2019ll be trying to get Russia to back off your flank and protect himself against an Austrian stab that is coming.", "Two bits of advice: #1 I suggest you tell Russia that Austria is coming for him. You really want Russia to move Sil back to Gal. You might also suggest to Russia that is he supports you to Denmark, you will then support Russia back to Sweden. I don\u2019t know yet if it actually makes sense to do that, but you want Russia thinking that you are eager to work with him. He\u2019ll be hoping for a reason to break off his attack on you at this point.", "#2 Here is the move set I would suggest right now:\nKiel Support Holland holding\nHolland Support Wales to Belgium (tell England you are going to order this support and he can take it or leave it)\nMunich Support Berlin holding\nBerlin Support Munich holding\n\nI think that both France and Russia are about to back off you, as they are both under fire at home. Just hold still, and soon you should be able to break out of this holding pattern.", "God, I hope so! I'm attempting to make that deal with russia now...and I'm talking with England re: Belgium", "It\u2019s none of my business, but if you do plan to take Denmark, I strongly recommend you wait until Fall. I think the most important thing for you right now is getting England fully committed against France. If that happens, taking Denmark later will be easy.", "I think me and England are really on the same page at this point regarding France. I'm actually sort of running counter-intelligence for England (and my friends to the south, of course!) with Russia right now. \n\nEngland and I talked about Denmark too...and it seems like one or the other of Denmark or Belgium should work out for me this year and I'm fine with that", "Great to hear. Thank you.", "Do you need me to disrupt Bur this year? I'll need to seriously trust Russia if I'm going to risk not holding my eastern front, I think...", "I do think a move to Burgundy makes sense for you this turn, and I can\u2019t imagine Russia attacking you here. He has a serious Austria problem. \n\nI suggest this:\nMun - Bur\nRuh - Bel\nHol Support Ruh - Bel \nBer - Kie\n\nTell Russia that the last thing in the world you want to see is Austria run him over, and you\u2019re willing to help keep Russia viable if necessary (you\u2019re angling for Russia to disband his northern holdings this turn).", "And ask England nicely to support Ruh - Hol, with the explanation that you don\u2019t plan to ask for Denmark back, but you think it would help you both to diminish France. (You\u2019ll get Den back eventually, but you want England to think you don\u2019t care about it).", "Thanks, I'll work on these. \n...Why didn't you scooch into the Aegean behind Austria? You could have defended or even held Bulgaria this turn?", "England and I were talking about your moves for this season--what do you think of convoying Pie into Spa, supporting this with Wes, and then moving Tyr into Pie?", "This leaves Marseilles open for Bur to fall into if France goes that route, which gives me an opening into Bur", "That\u2019s not bad.", "I was kind of thinking I should pick one or the other of Marseilles or Spain to attack and not tell a soul which one I\u2019m going after.", "Do you really think it\u2019s important to coordinate?", "I do think you\u2019re best off moving to Burgundy. And there is some chance that we fail this turn. But I think we just take a guess and hope for the best. We\u2019ll get him next turn if not this one.", "Okay\u2014sorry for being nosy! I will try for bur on the off chance it shakes out that way", "Nah, you\u2019re not being nosy at all. I mean, come on, we both know that I have no problem sticking my nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.", "Marked as true", "I like to coordinate, but on these sort of 50/50 guesses, I kind of like to keep it secret so that if it doesn\u2019t go well, I have nobody to blame but myself.", "Ha!", "Well, are you willing to humor my question about the Aegean, anyway?", "Sure. I was thinking of moving that fleet to Ionian. You think a move to Aegean is better? I\u2019m not really sure, but let\u2019s talk it through.", "No sorry I meant in hindsight--like this past turn you should have moved to Aeg so that this current turn, when Austria takes Rumania (from Bulgaria), you'd be there to cover Bulgaria so it couldn't get scooped by the Black sea, and potentially you'd just get to take it.", "Not a bad point. I agree.", "Hmmmm, kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won\u2019t hold it against you. You\u2019re in a tough spot.", "um what lie? I did exactly the moves you suggested!", "Ha! So sorry!! I meant that for France!", "You are my favorite.", "Marked as lie because clearly austria is your favorite.\nSpeaking of, I assume that your seizing Trieste was mutually agreed upon?", "Yes \u2014 agreed upon.", "That's not what Austria said to England...", "Hmmmm, okay. Well, let\u2019s just keep that between you and me then. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "You know italy, I think we *do* need to coordinate your move this time--England and I have a shot at either Bur or Mao if one of Marseilles or Spain can be left open for France to fall into. This will improve all of our chances of crushing France quickly.", "Okay, I can dig it. What do you want me to do?", "Let me confer with England and get back to you. Glad to hear that though!", "So...any thoughts on how to approach this?", "It looks like England's not willing to try for MAO if it means possibly losing the channel. However, they'll bring the NWG fleet around to try for MAO next year. \nSo if you could keep Marseilles open, it will help me to try and take Burgundy this turn.", "If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)", "Will do.", "Okay, so I still have a teensy little bone to pick with you: on the off-chance that Austria wasn't lying and you *did* take Trieste unexpectedly, I sort of worry that I might be next. Are you willing to tell me what your plans are for the Tri unit, or at least to warn me before any move into Tyrolia?", "Sure. But, you\u2019ll see from my moves this turn that Austria is lying to you.", "I currently have Tri - Tyrolia. I like the unit there because it sets up an attack on Austria if I ever want to go that route (build A Ven and go east). Do you want me to keep Tyrolia clear?", "I\u2019ll add \u2014 I would never attack Germany as Italy. Setting myself as a giant column like that is just not defensible. It would be a terrible move.", "Not when that column is not-so-giant and in a turf war with France.", "oh you mean setting *yourself*", "But you could easily pick off, say, Munich and not be a \"giant column\"", "I mean this sincerely: any Germany who does that is a terrible player. \n\nWhy would I do that? I would need 2-3 units to hold one center. That is a net negative. And all of your units are doing things that are good for me in containing your neighbors. \n\nI\u2019ve been working hard in this game for you to succeed and knock back France and England. I can say with 100% certainty: I\u2019m not going to attack you. I\u2019m going to keep helping you as much as I can.", "That said, if you want me NOT to move to Tyrolia, I won\u2019t move there.", "Nah, I just needed some reassurance :)\nYour logic is undenyable\u2014 enjoy your stay in tyr!", "*undeniable? That looks better", "I mean it sincerely. I think that England will want to coax me to attack you with him after France falls, but I\u2019d much rather work with you against England. \n\nBut first thing\u2019s first \u2014 let\u2019s get rid of France.", "Agreed", "(On the france part)", "Sorry I won't be able to cut off Gascony this turn...I probably should have just told you my moves; you could have advised me that supporting Mun-Bur was more important than Kie-Ruh", "No worries. We\u2019ll crack this but eventually. \n\nHere is my suggestion for this turn:\nKie - Den\nHol S Bel holding\nBel S Ruh - Bur\nMun S Ruh - Bur\nRuh - Bur", "I think you should suggest to England that he gets Sweden and St Petersburg, while you get Denmark back. That\u2019s only fair, as you have been a loyal ally in the fight against France and you plan to continue to do that.", "The moves I had already planned differ in one respect: I thought it would be worth the risk to try moving Hol-Bel and therefore move Bel-Bur. Even if me and France are high-fiving in Bel for a few seasons it's still mine, and it's not like Holland has anything better to do while I'm still allies with England.\n\n...The only reason I'm reluctant to make that agreement with England is that---while I think *you* and I have a good relationship---I really have not talked with Austria much at all, and I'm the next logical target for them when Russia's gone. And anything that's bad for Russia right now is good for Austria.", "Hmmmm, I\u2019m just not sure you should trust England enough right now to leave Holland open and Belgium essentially unguarded. \n\nFrance is a really good player, and he is no doubt working hard to get England to turn on you. My personal take is that you are better off being a bit more conservative until you have Denmark back and England has moved another fleet towards France. But I can see it either way.", "With regard to Russia, talk it through with England. What you don\u2019t want is England taking out Russia and giving you nothing. So, if England agrees to let Russia be for a while, then your plan sounds good. But if England is going to take Sweden, you really should get Denmark back. (I\u2019m my view)", "Okay you've convinced me: it's worth figuring out what E's plans are for Russia at least.\n\nAnd you're almost certainly right, from a rational perspective, about leaving Holland/Belgium vulnerable to England. But I think England really is counting on my assistance in taking France, and because of that and other non-quantifiable reasons I trust them.", "Excellent. Obviously you have a much better feel for your relationship with England than I do. Just know that France is persuasive, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what he\u2019s working on. He stopped talking to me, so I bet he\u2019s trying to turn England. Just keep reassuring England that you want to work with him long-term so he doesn\u2019t succumb to the Dark Side.", "Hi Germany \u2014 well, I think we\u2019re getting to a critical point in the game here. France held out a long time, but he\u2019s much less of a threat now. I think the critical issue, for you, is England. \n\nI have some thoughts on the matter, and some information, but I\u2019d like to feel confident that you and I will keep anything we say between us. I think of you as the one person who has been honest with me on every turn. You even tell me the truth when it\u2019s bad news, or when you don\u2019t completely trust me, and I like that.", "Okay, Italy. I won't share any of this conversation. But in the interest of continued full disclosure, here's what I think: England is a greater threat to *me* on the map, but *you* have a greater chance of soloing this game quickly, or pair-winning with Austria even sooner. And if I continue to collaborate with England, we at least have a chance of slowing that down. So I'm in sort of a conflicted spot", "This is why I like you. The full disclosure part. You tell me the truth even when the news isn\u2019t great.", "My thoughts on the \u201cGermany/England forever so that at least we can stop the solo\u201d strategy: (1) It\u2019s quite early to be talking about solos. I am at 8, and Austria could take 3 from me any time, quite easily. (2) I don\u2019t think England is thinking that way. I think he\u2019s thinking that a dominant power will emerge in the north, and one will emerge in the south. And he\u2019s like to be that dominant power.", "England\u2019s pieces are not positioned well if he\u2019s trying to attack France or contain Italy. He keeps Denmark guarded, and North Sea filled. He is not playing like he intends to stick with you, even though I\u2019m sure he\u2019s telling you that.", "You\u2019re right that you don\u2019t want to start a war with England right now. But, you must stick up for yourself, because nobody else will do that if you don\u2019t.", "If I were you, this is what I would do: (1) keep warning England about the dangers of Italy getting too big and insist that England moves his fleets towards MAO (Channel to Irish, Norwegian to NAO, North - Channel), (2) insist on taking Denmark back.", "I would say something like this:\n\nEngland, I\u2019m with you my friend, but we\u2019re passed the stage of you needing to keep me under lock and key. I need to take Denmark back. I\u2019m happy to support you to Brest to keep you growing, or you can grab Sweden. You have plenty of options other than keeping your ally\u2019s center, but if you really want to be my ally long-term, you\u2019ve got to show me that.", "I am hearing from England signs that he may be thinking of attacking you soon. And I think you actually avoid that better by being strong and sticking up for yourself rather than being accommodating and letting him do whatever he wants to do.", "Well, both you and France have now pointed out that England is strategically not in a good place to be my ally right now, and you are correct. I'll be more cautious with my northern border, but I made a pretty strong argument for denmark this past turn and it fell on deaf ears", "...which probably also should have been a sign for me", "Well, if you want, you could just take Denmark this next year and I don\u2019t think England is in a position to retaliate.", "Probably not...has France been talking with you at all about their sunsetting strategy? They've indicated a willingness to work with you and me and a desire to see England get as few dots as possible", "He did say that to me too. Though, France has a long history of lying to me, so I really don\u2019t trust him.", "Well France has actually been pretty honest with me, and I at least am certain that they wouldn't betray me to England. So, I'm considering working with F to sabotage (or potentially full-on backstab) England this turn, which would have the side-effect of maybe taking some attention away from the south for you anyway.", "(and I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this if you're in the mood to give out free advice)", "Hi Germany \u2014 sorry for the delay. Well...I think it\u2019s really important that you get a build this turn either way. I don\u2019t think England will get a build this turn, so if I were you I\u2019d probably take Paris, build a fleet, and move on England after that.", "But it likely depends on how communication is going with England. If he\u2019ll give you back Denmark, that might change the equation.", "I am waiting on England to make a decision about that--they claim to be thinking about it.", "England told me you said I was plotting with France. It makes sense you\u2019d want to pit us against each other.", "Hey \u2014 tried to send you a message earlier but not was down. England was telling me that you\u2019re saying that I told you that England is plotting against you. The problem with telling England that is that he will stop giving me useful info.", "Truly, I don\u2019t want you and England to fight. I am not trying to break you up. I suggested that you take Paris! I want you guys to work together with me against France.", "You don't want us to fight, yet you betrayed both of our confidence with you in a way that makes us distrust each other?", "I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair description. You guys both wanted to attack each other. I encouraged you both to keep working together.", "Just as long as it suits you. Are you going to give England Mao?", "Hmmm, should I be reading that as angry sarcastic with dagger eyes? (I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m getting your tone right)", "We\u2019re friends, right? I believe that every single message I\u2019ve sent you all game has been truth, and I\u2019ve gone out of my way to give you candid advice. Are we still friends?", "Regarding MAO \u2014 I don\u2019t know. What do you want me to do? I don\u2019t have any set plan.", "Yep, there's some sarcasm there. Looking back at your messages, I still don't read them as encouraging collaboration. And if you wanted us to be friends, you could have done that without betraying me to England by simply saying in your candid way \"I don't think you should do that for such and such reason\". But you chose to increase E's distrust of me. So I think you might be full of gnocchi and crap. \n\nMy trust in you is a bit shaken but I still think we can have a working partnership with a bit more caution on my end. It would be my preference that you hold Mao, on the assumption that if it came down to a choice between partnering with me or England, you'd choose me. If that's not the case, then as the filling of an England-Italy sandwich I'm in no position to retaliate anyway.", "Well, again, I like that you\u2019re honest with me, even when the news is bad.", "I have to say that I\u2019m surprised that you feel that I\u2019ve betrayed your trust. I have been feeling like maybe I\u2019ve been TOO helpful to you, and been a bit over the top in offering advice, etc., but it seems like I\u2019ve misread the situation.", "No, it's completely true that you've been too helpful, and I'm really really grateful for it because I've been able to learn so much from this game. But it's also true that you didn't have to tell England what you did, and all you stood to gain from it was that it shook my and E's trust in each other.", "But I understand what you\u2019re saying, and I much prefer to have a heart to heart like this, a frank airing of grievances, rather than being surprised by unkind moves on the board. https://youtu.be/xoirV6BbjOg", "Was not expecting seinfeld today and it was a pleasant surprise", "\ud83e\udd17", "Here\u2019s the deal: I like you better than England.", "I\u2019m not sure how the next couple of turns are going to shake out. But I like that you tell me when you\u2019re angry with me. I know that may seem like a small thing, but it\u2019s just rare in Diplomacy. You get so many fake smiles.", "So, if it comes down to you or him, I\u2019m choosing you. And I\u2019ll work to do a better job of keeping your confidence. I certainly understand how important that is, as I hate it when people o that same thing to me.", "So no more playing mediator for me.", "Okay. Is it true that you want the channel?", "And are you planning to keep Vienna?", "I am not planning to keep Vienna. And yeah I\u2019ve asked France for support to the Channel. Do you think he\u2019s on board?", "I'm not sure. Is *England* on board? Is this something England can know about?", "No, do you think France will Support me to the Channel?", "France has asked my opinion on it, and I haven't given it yet. To my estimation things look a lot better for me if you don't end up there: I don't want to see England in Mao, and I don't want to see you snagging pieces of the north.", "Okay, well, here is my thinking. Tell France whatever you want to make him happy. Then tell me how you really feel. And if you don\u2019t want me to go there, I won\u2019t go there.", "If I hadn't asked you about it, would that have just been another surprise, too?", "Absolutely. \n\nYou and I have discussed our moves and been honest with each other every turn. But we have not been sharing all our moves or pre-clearing all of our moves. So that would have Ben a surprise in the same way that your moves are a surprise to me. (I never tell you what to do or insist on knowing).", "I kind of thought that you would have wanted me in the Channel because it commits me further against England, but I can understand what you\u2019re saying now about wanting me to hang back.", "But I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with me contemplating moves without telling you all of them. You asked me about it, and I told you the truth.", "I do think that this move is a breach of general expectation, which is the kind of thing I'd like to know about. And it's also the kind of thing I've shared with you: case in point, my desire to stab England.", "Okay. Understood.", "Is there anything I could gain from seeing you in the channel? Would you support me taking Nth, and potentially seizing the island?", "Here's what I'm thinking: I would be on board with you taking the channel (and I'd give France the green light to go ahead with it) if you would agree to bump Nao out of Mao using Wes, and if you'd be open to supporting some anti-English aggression while holding the channel so that I can get on equal footing with you, dot-wise.\n\nIf you don't want to agree to those terms, that's okay, but I would strongly prefer not to see you in the channel in that case.", "I\u2019m going to be out of pocket this weekend, so let\u2019s talk this through more on Monday. Generally, I agree that I\u2019ll either stay out of the Channel or agree to your terms for entering there.", "If you decide to stay out of the channel, I have a deal that I like with England in the works. For that deal to go through, you'd have to agree to move Mao into Portugal to let England take Mao. Would you be amenable to that?", "(If this second offer is more to think about than a no-brainer, you can just mull it over and let me know monday)", "So, here is my concern with the England offer: If I\u2019m taking Portugal, why do we want England in MAO? And why would he want to go to MAO? I\u2019m not sure I understand that one. Can you explain?", "Well, when I initially proposed the deal I had forgotten that Portugal was promised to England. Then England agreed to it on the condition that you would confirm that move, so I figured E thought you would just move out of there next year? But now that I think about it, it\u2019s probably worth asking England why they\u2019d agree to that.", "I\u2019d prefer that you not tell England I am considering moving to the Channel. I don\u2019t think he would like that.", "I don\u2019t really want to discuss this stuff with England at all.", "Well, England changed their mind about the plan I offered anyway. So, are you taking the channel?", "No, I\u2019m not taking the Channel.", "Okay was that a recent decision? Because like an hour ago France said they were supporting you into the channel", "Well, when I tell you what I plan to do, do you turn around and tell France? This makes me uncomfortable speaking with you.", "I haven't spoken to France since then. I didn't realize you were giving the two of us different information on this particular subject. But I don't think I've revealed anything to them about what you plan to do. Mostly because you haven't told me.", "Well, I have been honest with both you and France. You told me that I need to promise you a set of things in order to take the Channel. I felt like it was more than I could be sure of doing, so I am not entering the Channel. I won\u2019t go there without your permission.", "I appreciate that. And I'll keep the remainder of this conversation between us unless I hear otherwise. Have you just recently made an agreement with England?", "I heard as much but I want to verify the contents of that agreement with you", "Btw, France just said that they submitted the orders to support you into the channel.", "I don\u2019t have an agreement with England, but he is asking me about my moves and trying to get my help.", "Okay--then England is lying to me, saying that you're helping support Eng-Brest.", "Ha! Yeah, fat chance.", "...but did you lie to England about that? Or can I say to England that I don't think you'll actually provide that support?", "What is Paris up to?", "I suggest you just not tell England anything about my moves.", "Do you want me to support England to Brest?", "I guess I\u2019m not sure what your goals are here.", "I just kind of feel like you\u2019re grilling me with a lot of questions, but not telling me what you\u2019re doing or what you want from me.", "*If* you support Eng-Brest, England has agreed to vacate denmark for me. If you don't, I won't get in the way of your channel thing. Any other questions?", "I have no sense of what you want or what your plan is, but I thought I'd been pretty clear: I want Denmark. I am reluctant to see you in the Channel if England remains powerful, but happy to see you there if they are weakened.", "Can\u2019t you just force Denmark?", "Not without risking a swipe of Belgium", "And why force when you don't have to", "Okay, I\u2019ll support England to Brest. You take Denmark.", "And you and I should be in position to take out England next year.", "Splendid!", "Glad everything worked out \ud83d\ude03", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Congratulations on retaking Denmark and getting two builds. You are playing really well right now. Respect.", "Congrats on having double-digit dots! I have some thoughts about taking out England, if you want to go full-stab this season...", "I think I do! \ud83e\udd2b", "What are you thinking?", "One option is to take the channel, another is to take Brest. Between you, me, and Picardy we can manage either, but it's a question of which takes priority. If we chose Brest, I could also take a stab at seizing Nth this season, then we could try for the channel in fall. Or we could do channel first, Brest second.", "Yeah, that is all along the lines of what I\u2019m thinking. How demanding does France sound right now? Does he want to be the one who takes Brest?", "Haven't asked. But in general not demanding.", "Good!\n\nStill, I think we should show him some good faith by supporting him to Brest in Spring. We can decide in Fall whether it makes more sense for you to take it, but I think we want to keep France hungry.", "I would suggest something like this to ensure the English fleet is disbanded:\nPic - Bre\nMAO - Channel\nPar S Pic - Bre", "And Spa - Gas to cut off that retreat.", "You can take the North Sea on the same move and set up a convoy to the English mainland. \n\nCheckmate.", "Okay, I like the plan! I've asked France if they're willing to move to Brest supported by me.", "Aren't you concerned about England taking Mao? I'd sooner just have you pile on support into Bre so that Wes can support Mao holding", "That\u2019s a good point, but the problem with that approach is that Brest is not guaranteed. If England cute MAO and supports with the Channel, the attack fails. I think we are better off ensuring that the Brest fleet is disbanded. If we disband that fleet and take North Sea, an English fleet in MAO really just spreads him out and allows you to take the island faster. It\u2019s not like he can get Portugal or Spain.", "Okay, but that means I'd prefer to take Brest myself this Spring, if France is okay with it.", "I think that we should offer France Brest in Spring. That ensures that he is with us. Then, if conditions are right in the Fall, I can support you into Brest. But...England can offer France Belgium, and I think he is sure to take that if we\u2019re not even offering him a center, right?", "Better to keep France feeling like we\u2019re going to keep him in the game. If you need the build in Fall, it\u2019s easy for me to support you there.", "I guess I\u2019m just wondering from France\u2019s perspective why they\u2019d *want* to stay in the game. Isn\u2019t it possible they\u2019d rather move on with their life? That\u2019s not rhetorical, I\u2019m wondering what your perspective is as a veteran player", "Here is my take: If France just wanted to go down in a blaze of glory and say \u201ceff you\u201d to England, he would have kept Irish Sea. He kept Pic, which is next to his home center, and gives him a chance to negotiate with both you and England.", "I think that means he is motivated to keep trying. And if he believes he can get Brest, he could legitimately get back to his feet. I know that\u2019s what I\u2019d be trying to do in his position.", "As the poker saying goes: \u201ca chip and a chair.\u201d So long as you have one chip left, and you\u2019re still in the tournament, you can always come back to win.", "Thoughts?", "I think that makes sense. Are you talking with England at all?", "I\u2019m pretty wary of England right now. He asked me what I want to do, but I feel like he\u2019s trying to get me to leave MAO open. That\u2019s not terrible news, as it suggests that he won\u2019t expect your move to North Sea.", "As long as he doesn\u2019t move NAO to Norwegian, you\u2019ve got a guaranteed supply center.", "Well E'd have to be a right dolt not to retreat to NWG. And right now they're talking to me about supporting a move from Bre to Gas (the better for the two of us to stab you).", "What i mean is, there's a good chance that Mao is safe if I \"agree\" to that deal", "Oh nevermind--they're not going to convoy into Brest. So actually this pretty much guarantees that Eng and Nao will try for Mao.", "Ahhhh, sneaky Devil! Thank you for letting me know.", "I still like our plan.", "I need to run for a bit. I\u2019ll be around in a few hours.", "I think that knowing this, you should do as I suggest and not poke Eng. Just hold and let Wes support. I am 94% sure I can trust England to do as they say on this one.", "Okay. Should I support Pic to Bre?", "yes please. It'll do us good with France too if we both support.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Actually, you should use Mao to support Spa-Gas, since we know that Brest is moving there. It will be beneficial to have you there if we decide to oust France from Bre in fall", "Consider it done.", "Hmmmm, heading anything from England?", "I\u2019d love to talk if you\u2019re there. I\u2019m getting the impression that England may actually be moving on you, and I think I have a good counter, but I also still think we should support the attack on Brest and take North Sea.", "I definitely think you should keep your moves the same.", "Nice! Get\u2019em! He WAS moving on you. But we should be able to take about 3 off of him now. Very nice turn.", "Sorry; I was asleep by 9 last night \ud83d\ude02  \n\nwhy the move to Nao? Wouldn't IRI be the more anti-England choice?\n\nWith the move to Picardy and assuming a retreat to SKA, it looks like England has me pretty powerless this turn.", "So do you, it seems, if you have some kind of deal with Russia about Munich.", "Good morning. \n\nJust responding to your messages above. I think NAO and Irish are equally anti-English. They both give me a clear lane to attack Liverpool. I wasn\u2019t sure if either one would be left open, but I took a gamble and it paid off.", "Re your move this turn, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re powerless. You should get a build I think and if not, you should be in position to smash England.", "I don\u2019t have a deal regarding Munich, Germany. Frankly, I thought you would be a bit more joyful towards me. By attacking England, I have committed completely to working as your partner.", "I suppose you're right. Initially I was thinking IRI also gives you channel access, but NWG access may be just as useful. \n\nWell when you control half a continent (and even more when you consider your influence over me, austria, and who knows who else!), there's no such thing as complete commitment. I'm not so naive as to think your allegiance with me is going to last beyond its usefulness, and with two fleets on the British isle that time is fast approaching. To be clear, I'm still giving you the truth and I still want to work with you. But you should really stop acting surprised when I'm slightly paranoid that a soon-to-be-dozen-dot-holder is gearing up to stab me", "Well, I dunno, it sounds like I should stab you. Is that what you\u2019re trying to tell me?\n\nI like you. I like how hard you\u2019ve worked in this game to rebound from a difficult start. I like that you e told me the truth, even when the news was bad. I like that you tell me when you don\u2019t trust me. I have literally never told you a lie in this game, and I don\u2019t intend to start now. Last turn I burned my bridge with England beyond repair. If you don\u2019t want to work with me now, that\u2019s really disappointing.", "like I said, I *do* want to work with you. However, remember that thing I said about general expectations and being warned when they're broken? Tyrolia is one of them and I think you knew that. And England *also* told me they've never told me a lie; I'm starting to think that's Diplomacy-speak for \"when convenient, I've used careful wording and half-truths to deceive you even when everything I said was technically true\". \n\nIt would help me to know that you see me being a benefit to you beyond taking out England. A natural next move for us would be to take out russia, and in that arena I have a positional advantage over you. Especially if I get two builds this turn, I'll be able to sneak behind the troops in bohemia/galicia and help you break through.", "Yes \u2014 here is how I expect and hope the game will play out: the two of us finish off England and France, while drifting towards the east a bit. With the builds we get this year, we essentially blitzkrieg the East. I have more units than you, but you have no opposition at all in the north, and can take Scandinavia, War and Mos without any trouble.", "I think that, in about two years, you and I will both be on about 14 centers, with the remnants of Russia and Austria between us, and we can decide how we want to resolve it. I\u2019d be happy to agree to a small draw, or to shoot for a 17-17 two-way draw position, whichever you prefer.", "Well, I like the sound of all of that. In fact, it sounds ideal: there's something poetic about the complete beginner and the expert (you've probably heard by now that you got doxxed) sharing a victory. \n\nI ask for a concession: As a show of good will, would you be willing to take only one of Liverpool or Portugal this year? (I know the Portugal request seems weird, but I like keeping France around and unless I'm mistaken they like me better than you \ud83d\ude03 )", "Yes. I wasn\u2019t planning to take Portugal anyway.", "I think it makes sense here for you to land an army in the English island while you can. Now that his army is off the island, he\u2019s toast as soon as you do that.", "England's just vindictive enough to try and stab Belgium with England and Picardy, though. I was planning on keeping holland around as support.", "*by England I of course mean Eng", "I suggest the following:\n\nGas - Liv (via convoy)\nSpa S MAO holding\nMar hold\nTyr - Tri\n\nHol - Yor (via convoy)\nBur S Bel\nBel S North\nHEL S North\nMun - Boh\nPar - Pic (to cut any potential support)", "England cannot take Belgium with those moves.", "Or I could move my fleet into Liverpool and use Gas to support Bre. I\u2019m happy either way.", "I tried a double convoy in the sandbox once and it didn't work! What is this witchcraft?!?", "At any rate, I prefer the fleet move to liverpool and Gascony's support into Brest. And could Mao support Bre into the Channel? No sense forcing France to disband. Bel will support it, too.", "Here are the orders needed to do a convoy!\nHolland move to Yorkshire\nNorth Sea convoy Holland to Yorkshire\n\nIt is not a \u201cdouble convoy\u201d as you only need one fleet to make it happen. \n\nBut if your fleet in North Sea is dislodged, the convoy will not go through. That is why I would suggest that HELG supports North Sea holding and Belgium supports North Sea holding.", "No--I mean the one *you* were planning: Gascony to Liverpool", "It's a double convoy because you're convoying through Mao *and* Nao", "Ah, the orders there would be:\nGascony - Liv\nMAO Convoy Gas - Liv\nNAO Convoy Gas - Liv", "So, I\u2019ll move the fleet to Liverpool. And you want MAO to support Paris to Brest?", "Or wait, MAO supports Brest to Channel, and Gas supports Paris - Brest, right?", "yeah. I tried that once in the sandbox (or the equivalent: back when you had fleets in Lyo and Wes I tried  a convoy from Pie to Naf). But I think I messed up the commands to the fleets. \n\n And yes the most recent message is correct. Those two things and Nao-Lvp", "Okay, confirmed. \n\nSo I\u2019ve got in:\nNAO - Liv\nMAO S Bre - Channel\nGas S Par - Bre\nSpa - WES\nMar S Gas holding \nTyrolia - Trieste\n\nSound right?", "It does. But If Tyr was bound for trieste anyway, why did you detour through Tyr at all? Why not just move to trieste last turn??", "Austria would not have liked it.", "And he doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s headed back there now (please don\u2019t tell)", "Understood. Me and Austria don't talk anyway. Also, do you have any sense of what England is planning to do?", "Ha! No I don\u2019t. I\u2019d imagine he is coming for me. But I don\u2019t know that.", "If I were him, I\u2019d defend Edi and London.", "So you haven't been talking to England at all? I was sort of hoping you would know more, maybe help us take better advantage of their plans.", "Anyway, my moves are:\n\nPar-Bre\nBel s Bre-Eng\nHol s Bel holding\n\nAnd the rest within expected parameters. Correct?", "England has not said anything of substance to me. He was gracious about my move, but he won\u2019t trust me again, and I would not trust anything he might say at this point. I haven\u2019t asked him about his moves and he hasn\u2019t told me.", "I thought you would Convoy Holland to Yorkshire and support Belgium from Burgundy. Also, can you please order Mun to Boh to cut support and allow me to hold Vienna while moving Tyrolia to Trieste?", "I *told* you I'm not risking that convoy *and* that instead Bel is supporting France into the Channel (which will heretofore be called the French Channel). And could I persuade you to move to IRI instead of taking Liverpool in exchange for the requested cut?", "Sorry, what is the requested cut? I understand that you don\u2019t want me to take Liverpool or Portugal. What are you offering to me? (I don\u2019t mean to be difficult, I just want to be sure I understand).", "Ah, you must mean Munich to Boh.", "Asking me to avoid taking Por and Liv is asking a lot. I want France to survive here, but I also want England taking units off the board, and I feel like you should too, right?", "I do. But I also want those dots for myself, of course. And there's still the nonzero chance that you've arranged with Boh to take Munich for yourself, so I'm taking a serious risk", "I will avoid taking Portugal, vacate Tyrolia, and support you to Brest. I feel like I\u2019m offering quite a lot in exchange for one cut support. \n\nAnd cutting that support does not put you in greater peril. If I had a deal with Russia for Munich (I don\u2019t) I could cut Burgundy from Marseilles and support Russia to Munich. Moving Mun to Boh to cut support is costless.", "You're right. I just thought I'd put my best argument forward. I'll do the cut. But I ask for something costless in exchange, and I really, really want it to stay just between us, ok?", "Understood and agreed.", "And I have no problem with you asking for more than you\u2019re willing to settle for. That\u2019s smart, and I do the same thing sometimes. If you don\u2019t stick up for yourself, nobody else will.", "I *know* there's more to your relationship with England than you're telling me. The last message England sent to me hinted that if *I* wasn't willing to work with them--and I haven't said anything to them since--that maybe *you* would. And if England were to reach out to you, you're too smart to just snub them. There's advantage to be gained--either for both of us or just for yourself--from talking to them. The only reason I stopped was because I knew my word would be mud to them anyway.\n\nEarlier I was hoping you'd give me the truth about what you knew, and about what they might know. But you didn't and that both disappoints and scares me. So I'm asking that you give me just a modicum of honesty here: what do you know? what does England know?", "I give you my word: I don\u2019t know what England is going to do and I haven\u2019t asked.", "He is still jovial with me and respectful. He has asked me to critique his play and to give him advice. But I do not know his moves, and I really don\u2019t think he would tell me them if I asked. It certainly would not be info I could trust free I just lied to him about mine.", "But England's desperate. Better to talk with *someone* than just go in blind. And I doubt they'd turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there's precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France.\n\n...and here's the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you've been sneaky and you've always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so *easy* to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. \n\nI know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now. \n\nI'm offering this confession in hopes that you'll do the same. So just come clean and let's approach this thing as equals?", "I am in my car, off to pick-up my kids from school. This deserves a proper response, so please give me some time.", "Abandon the children this is important \ud83d\ude1c", "So, I\u2019m going to speak frankly here. I am rarely offended in a Diplomacy game, and I rarely say so when I am, but this message offends me. I\u2019m trying to think about why I\u2019m having such a strong reaction to it. I think it\u2019s because you\u2019re painting a picture of the game (both your actions and mine) which are totally different than my own perspective. (Continuing)", "From my perspective, you were on the ropes early. France and England were teaming up on you. You lost Denmark and France had Holland and Munich surrounded. You were in serious peril. \n\nI seriously went to extreme effort to keep you in the game. I spent hours talking with England and encouraging him to turn around and go the other way. I completely ended my eastern campaign and spent two seasons just making the voyage over to France so that he didn\u2019t have the bandwidth to continue his attack. I have vouched for you with Austria and Russia many times. I have supported Munich. And I have NEVER attacked you, even when people have asked me to do so and pledged to support me.", "I have been honest with you, I have worked hard for your success, and I\u2019ve made a lot of proposals to you in which you gain centers; not me. \n\nMaybe I am just a bad ally, but I\u2019m not sure I remember an alliance in which I have done more to help my ally. Truly.", "And to hear that (1) You think I\u2019ve been selfish and (2) You\u2019ve been sabotaging me all along, that just doesn\u2019t sit well with me.", "I have rarely asked for your help, and I\u2019ve offered my help freely. I\u2019ve provided my sincere best efforts to help you with tactics, and I have never sabotaged you. Not once.", "And if I\u2019m totally honest with you, I could solo this game if I felt like lying to everyone and grabbing dots. I think I\u2019ve got you all beat tactically. I just have more experience. But that\u2019s not been my intent.", "I\u2019ve spent hours today talking with England about how best to play Diplomacy. I\u2019ve tried to give him some honest advice because he asked for it. But I don\u2019t know his moves, I haven\u2019t asked for them, and I\u2019m not going to take advantage of that relationship to try to stab you. It legitimately did not cross my mind until you accused me of doing it.", "So, I\u2019m frustrated by this accusation.", "And I appreciate all you\u2019ve done for me, really I do. But \u201ccompletely ending your eastern campaign\u201d is *not* something you did for me; your alliance with Austria dictated that. \nI felt bad for betraying you while I was doing it, but even then I knew it was the only way to keep the game going in the face of your and Austria\u2019s might. And it *wasn\u2019t* \u201call along\u201d, it was a few turns at best so that the rest of us would have a shot at you and Austria not pair-winning right out of the gate. And the only thing that keeps me from thinking you\u2019re not gonna do just that on the next move anyway is my belief that you really do want the victory all to yourself, which is still consistent with everything you\u2019ve done for me. Propping up a weak player at the expense of stronger ones is a classic tactic. (Continuing)", "And so, by the way, is trying to shame someone for raising extremely legitimate concerns. Whenever I bring up suspicion of you, you\u2019re quick to remind me how much you\u2019ve done for me to put me on the defensive and make me feel indebted. Well frankly that reeks of dishonesty. I never asked you to do those things.", "If you no longer trust me, so be it. I knew that was a risk when I made my confession. But i\u2019d rather have a partnership based on mutual honesty. That\u2019s another reason I confessed\u2014you ought to know that my game philosophy (new as it is) is to trust the map and to trust history first and foremost. The parts of your history that I\u2019ve seen indicate that you\u2019re no saint, no matter what you may have done for me. And when the map shows that one player is clearly dominating and that player is you, you are being deeply naive if you think everyone else is just going to roll over and let you get away with it", "No, all thumbs up from me. If I were lying to you, I\u2019d smile and say \u201cthat sounds great.\u201d I\u2019m honest with you because I sincerely thought of us as partners.", "Oh but you\u2019re *not*! You agreed to warn me of unexpected moves, then didn\u2019t. When I brought this up you ignored it and misdirected me in hopes I\u2019d forget. You\u2019ve revealed things to England without my permission, and then made up a story about it after the fact!\n\nAnd you can\u2019t be a real partner with someone who is depending on your good graces to survive. That\u2019s not a partnership. We could never be real partners unless we had some notion of equality, and I\u2019m outmatched in both skill and numbers.\n\nYou and Austria, however, were until recently a perfect example of a true partnership. Dot-parity, coordinated attacks, really beautiful work. So don\u2019t act as if you don\u2019t know this to be true. We were never a partnership of that kind.", "Well, this is very disappointing to me, and I obviously disagree with the way you are characterizing me and this game. \n\nI have a reputation in this hobby for being sincere. Not for being duplicitous. It has always served me well. \n\nIf you feel that way, then me continuing to explain myself isn\u2019t going to change your mind. If you don\u2019t want to work with me, then I can understand that. Let\u2019s consider our deals and commitments to be void, and let\u2019s play our games separately. \n\nIf you have any deal you\u2019d like to propose, I\u2019ll consider them, but I won\u2019t continue to try to help your game if you think I\u2019m not sincerely trying to be helpful.", "Well, this game just got less fun.", "for you, maybe.", "Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y\u2019all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would \u201cteach him\u201d and help his along to second place. Then y\u2019all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)", "(Part 2)\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I\u2019m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for \u201cHey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,\u201d but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that\u2019s really my preference. \n\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can\u2019t solo. And I\u2019m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I\u2019m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany\u2019s favor. \n\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.\ud83e\udd17", "I'm down for a five-way draw. \n\n...and by the way, England was copy-pasting to me the most incriminating messages you sent them. So I knew you were giving England my moves. I do have a certain begrudging respect for you ability to deny, though \ud83d\ude09", "Well, England is telling me he is happy to see me solo and wants second place...so, should I say \u201cno\u201d? I guess I should have. I was happy the way the game was going before all that.", "Don't try and pin *your* greed and deceit on England! At least *own* it when you're ruthless", "You have been given an apple laced with poison. England\u2019s only move there was to make you hate me, and he did his job well. \n\nYou should not let your view of me be defined by someone who has an incentive to make you never speak to me again. We can talk about it more after the game, but I had every intention of continuing to work with you, and I would have done that until England made his play.", "I have no doubt you would have continued to work with me, but I take issue with someone who can be asked point-blank if they're sharing moves with another player and lie to my face. If you'd come clean, and explained how what you were doing actually *helped* me, somehow, we could have worked together. But you would rather have had me in the dark and that's not sustainable in a partnership.", "I was trying to play both sides, and England was lying to me, and forwarding my press to try to incriminate me. So, yes, I lied, and so did England. I apologize.", "Will you please either vote to draw, or let us know that you\u2019d like to play this one out? I am finding it difficult to motivate myself to speak with anyone if the game is just going to draw shortly. Thoughts?", "I did vote to 5-way draw! And I did so again for this season. So it\u2019s not me who\u2019s keeping this game alive", "Well, as we approach the end of the academic study portion of the game, let me say once, with the truth detector activated, that I really enjoyed playing with you and thought you played really well.", "Was it really your first game? You definitely played like a seasoned vet.", "I really enjoyed playing with you, too! And yes, it really was my first game.

{"messages": ["Hello there! What's your general plan for this game? My inclination when I play Austria is to piss off as few people as possible, so I don't plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn.", "Hi Austria. Nice to meet you, and looking forward to playing as your neighbor. \n\nHmmmm, I hate playing as Italy. I rarely succeed. Frankly, I\u2019ve recently tried early attacks on Austria, as Italy, AND IT KEEPS TURNING OUT POORLY. I\u2019d really like to play this one as a tight-knit Central Trio if you have any appetite for that. Not sure if I should set up a Lepanto or go west, but I\u2019d be happy to hear your thoughts on it.", "That sounds good to me. I think probably what would work best is if you and Germany go west while Turkey and I contain and/or eat Russia, then once I've picked up some Russian dots and gotten some good position, you split your fleets to help me take Turkey and help Germany take England.", "I like that. Let me talk it over with Germany.", "I\u2019m not sure whether Germany is keen on attacking France. Perhaps you and I should focus on Turkey?", "Yeah, honestly, the more I think about it, the more I think it'll just be easier to wipe turkey off the map really quickly. I've done it in tourneys a few times before and it just makes everything simpler.", "\ud83d\udc4c So I\u2019ll open as a standard Lepanto. Sounds good.", "Nice start!\n\nReally glad to see Turkey open north, and glad to see that you were true to your word with me. I feel like we\u2019re in a really strong position to control the East!\n\nWhat are you thinking?", "Yep! Good start, now we've just gotta follow through properly.", "So, do I just convoy my army to Tunis?\n\nAlso, do you want me to bounce you in Trieste?", "Sure, Trieste bounce is a good idea. And yeah, standard Lepanto with the convoy.", "So...how shall we go about this? I\u2019m kind of thinking that you and I should eat some Turkey.", "That's exactly what I'm thinking. I'm going to send Greece into the Aegean, you send Ionian into Eastern Med.", "Okay. Cool! Do you mind if I take Greece this year while you take Bulgaria? That will keep us even, and should be guaranteed. I can just convoy an army to Greece in Spring while you move to Aegean, and I can support you to Bulgaria in the Fall. This also means you don\u2019t have to rotate your armies all the way to Greece, which will allow you to mobilize against Russia faster when the time comes. \n\nThoughts?", "Any thoughts on this idea?", "I am going to send my fleet over to Eastern Med and we can work this out next turn.", "Sorry about that, today got a little nuts. Figuring it out next turn is probably the best call, once we see what's worked and what hasn't.", "Okay, thank you for being true to your word. \n\nI think we\u2019re in great shape. My major concern on the board right now is E/F, which is likely going to take down Germany quickly and become a major force. \n\nIt is really important to me to get a build here so that I can try to keep France in check a bit. Will you agree that You get Bulgaria, I get Greece, and we can move forward with both of us at 5?\n\nI really think that the two of us can dominate this game if we keep working together.", "Yep, I'm just fine with that.", "Great!\n\nI will convoy Tunis to Greece. If you can support that move, that would be great. And it looks like you\u2019ll have no problem supporting Greece to Bulgaria.", "I'll have a more direct response once the retreats are all resolved and I'm not extrapolating what the board state will probably be, but that seems eminently doable.", "How\u2019s it looking over there?", "Looking solid! I don't think we actually need to coordinate all that much, we're in a really good position.", "Just to be clear, should I expect Greece will be open?", "Yep, it will be. I'll want it back eventually, but for now it's yours.", "You, sir, are a terrific ally. This was more than you needed to do, but makes me feel like this is really a long term thing! Thank you.", "We can do great things together, long term. I figured a down-payment now against that great future would be worth it.", "Plus, you ever try digging out a talented Italy as Austria? It's a pain in the fuckin neck! :P", "\ud83e\udd17", "Yeah, let\u2019s just work together. Should be a good one for both of us.", "What should I build? I\u2019m pretty undecided and would be willing to let you choose.", "I think probably a fleet will serve you best, in terms of flexibility. We've got Turkey, he's doomed by numbers, so you want to start thinking France.", "\ud83d\udc4c", "Okay, how would you like to approach this turn? I\u2019m at your disposal.", "I think what we do is, AEG convoys GRE-SMY with support from EAS while BUL taps CON", "That's just an initial thought, though - if you have a better idea I'm all ears", "My concern there is that Arm doesn\u2019t have much to do other than support Smyrna, and I don\u2019t know if we want to rely on Russia helping. I think he has a serious incentive to prevent us from succeeding too quickly against Turkey.", "Very good point. Perhaps you tap SMY with EAS and I use AEG to support BUL-CON, with the intention of then doing the convoy in the fall?", "What do you think of Aegean support Bul to Con while I cut support in Smy? That is guaranteed so long as Russia does not support Con back to Bul (unlikely), and we don\u2019t have to tell Russia the complete plan.", "Yes, we xposted, but we are thinking the same way.", "Well it appears our messages passed each other in the internet's series of tubes, but, great minds, etc etc", "Good. Consider it done.", "I\u2019m thinking about sending an army over to Piedmont to keep France honest. Do you think that is a good idea or a terrible idea? I just want to avoid a stampede over Germany, and I feel like forcing him to use an army in Marseilles to bounce with me is worth dedicating one army from me. But I don\u2019t want to antagonize I\u2019ve him either. I keep going back and forth about it. What do you think?", "I think probably we give France one season to see what they do. England build F LON and France built F BRE, which is something we should keep an eye on before moving.", "Okay. If he does say anything to you about moving towards me, would you please let me know? I feel like he\u2019s in an awfully strong position, and it makes me nervous.", "You'll be the first to know. Man, isn't this game simpler when you're being honest?", "\ud83d\udc4d", "France says they're getting radio silence from England, which is probably good news for us.", "Russia says you're trying to get him to attack me, heh", "That sounds like the kind of thing Russia would say. \n\nI have generally told Russia that I am not close with you and I\u2019d be willing to attack you, but I\u2019ve never \u201ctried to get him to attack you. That is a complete \ud83d\udc4e. \n\nOur alliance seems to be the one trusting alliance in the game. Everyone is going to try to break us up. We need to prevent it.", "That's about what I figured. Wanted to let you know it was being tried.", "Also, England is extremely unhappy with France.", "Yeah, sounds like England is attacking France. That\u2019s good for us. We seem to be the only alliance that has its act together.", "Which can mean only profit for us, as long as we stick together.", "Word. \n\nListen, I\u2019m an alliance player. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve always been. I think it\u2019s the only way to play. I don\u2019t like to shift around. I like a close working relationship with a partner. That\u2019s what we have, and that\u2019s what I plan to stick with as long as you\u2019ll have me.", "'til death or end of beta do us part, then \ud83d\ude1b", "That said, I don\u2019t want anyone else to know that. So if people ask, I\u2019ll tell them that I\u2019d be happy to attack you.", "Oh naturally, I'll bullshit the hell outta everyone else.", "Sooooooooo. Tyrolia?", "Test", "You don\u2019t like it? I figured it was the same as Venice. If I wanted to attack you, I could have just moved to Trieste any time. \n\nMy purpose in Tyrolia is to keep Munich black. I\u2019m just going to support Munich holding. I don\u2019t want Germany to get trampled.", "I'd have preferred a heads-up, is all.", "So, we going with the same plan? I convoy Greece over to Smyrna?", "Sorry \u2014 I\u2019ve been slammed all day. Just looking at this again now.", "Okay, I\u2019m so sorry. I got distracted again. Yes! I will order GRE to SMY, EAS S GRE to SMY, TYR S MUN holding. \n\nWill you allow me a build this turn or do you plan on retaking Greece now?", "Sounds good to me.", "Any word on Greece?\n\nBasically, if I get a build this turn I can turn around and smash France. If I don\u2019t, that will be a more tepid attack.", "I've got no need to immediately take it, since I'm picking up Con.", "Okay. Thank you. \ud83d\ude0a", "Hey, by the way, I am going to be candid here: I have thought about attacking you. I really have. But I have recently arrived at the conclusion that this would be a poor path forward. I\u2019m not going to do it. \n\nI\u2019ll move on France now. That will give you the peace of mind to know that my units will be occupied and far from you.", "Glad to hear, yep!", "Let\u2019s just keep right on working together, and press our advantage b", "I suggest you move Alb to Ser and prepare to attack Russia in Spring.", "You can have Ank, but I really do think it makes sense that I keep Greece. Ending up with 2 centers from Turkey/Balkans seems fair, with you getting everything else, yes?", "Yeah, I think I can live with that.", "Sorry it took me a moment to respond, it's the MLB home run derby tonight", "Well that, I can understand.", "Look, like I said, I was wavering a bit, especially during the long weekend. But, I\u2019ve taken a close look, and I just think that this alliance has unique staying power. I really do. We both have room to grow. Now that England attacked France, there isn\u2019t really anyone who can stop us. This can work long term, and work well.", "I wholeheartedly agree. Neither of us benefits from attacking the other.", "So, This one seems easy. I\u2019ll support you to Ankara, and you are guaranteed either Ankara or Rumania:\n\nCon - Ank\nSmy S Con - Ank\nAge - Con\nEAS S Smy holding\nVen - Pie\nTyr S Mun holding\nTYS - LYO\nTun - WES\nSer - Rum\nBul S Ser - Rum\nBud S Ser - Rum\nVie - Gal\n\nSound right?", "I had already entered every single one of those orders, except for AEG-CON, which is in now. It's nice being on the same page, isn't it?", "\ud83d\udc4d", "I kind of figured. It\u2019s a pretty straight-forward move for both of us, and likely gains for both of us. This alliance is in a really healthy place.", "So, I assume you're going to support Ank to hold?", "Also, fyi, I'm in transit to SkyCon out in Montana, so I might not be the most communicative gent this weekend.", "Hi Austria. I apologize for the delay. Quite a busy day for me yesterday. \n\nI have no problem supporting Ank to hold.", "I also want to say \u2014 looks like that support ensures you get two builds. My own attack on France is not quite so successful. Do you mind if I borrow Trieste this turn to stay even with you and keep my momentum going west. I\u2019ll place another fleet with it, which further locks me in moving away from you. I think that\u2019s actually quite good for you, but I know some players get prickly about home centers.", "A dot is a dot is a dot. It's better for the long term health of the alliance, and I'm still building one. More importantly, your best/easiest route to growth still lies in France, not with me, so I don't see you having a ton of incentive to go after me. Go for it.", "OMG. \ud83d\ude2e You are my favorite ally of all time. This just happened. You just past the threshold. It used to be this guy who was playing France to my England. Funny dude. Great stories. But he never sacrificed a home center in the interest of parity. \n\nYou are a rare gem.", "Do you think 17-17 is an okay result for a beta test?", "I feel like I can\u2019t stab you now. So I\u2019d like to simply crush the board with you.", "I've never said no to 17/17, lol", "What's your planned build?", "F Nap. Sound good?", "Yeah, Naples makes it look like we might actually be fighting, go for it.", "Well, I hope you had a nice weekend. Do you think we have much to discuss here? Is there anything you\u2019d like me to do with my three eastern units? Do you want me to pretend to fight you, or shall I just move away or hold still? I don\u2019t really have any idea what I should be doing.", "My weekend was great! I placed 8th at SkyCon, which was a disproportionately talented tourney, so I'm feeling quite good about myself. I'd like your army in Smyrna to support my move from Ankara to Armenia, but other than that, I see no point in pretending to fight each other, so I figure you might as well move stuff west to take care of your new main front.", "Okay, that works for me.", "Do you want me to move Eastern Med to Aegean? If your move to Armenia works (likely), you may want to use my fleet to bounce with you at Con to keep The Russian fleet out. But totally up to you. I don\u2019t care either way.", "Right now I've just got my fleet in Con tapping Black, so it'll probably stay full. Get the fleet where it can help with France.", "Thoughts on where we go from here?", "My units are at your disposal.", "I think the best way to take Rum would look like this:\nBul - Rum\nSer and Bud S Bul - Rum\nCon - Bul (EC)\nArm and Smy bounce in Ank\nTyr and Gal bounce in Vienna\n (Anticipating that Black Sea will likely move to Bul to cut support)", "Everything still okay?", "I like it, yeah, let's do that.", "Folks are trying to pry us apart, but their arguments aren't making a ton of sense.", "Yeah, I\u2019m getting the same treatment. \n\nIf we stay together, we win together.", "Argh! I KNEW Black Sea would try for Bulgaria!!! Shoot!", "My wife says I am bossy and uniquely inflexible. I don\u2019t want you to feel that way too! How shall we approach this next turn? I think we need to put in a good set of orders here to turn the tide against Russia.", "Here's what I've got right now: \nA Arm - Sev\nF BLA - Con\nA Bud S Gal - Rum\nA Gal - Rum\nA Rum - Bul\nA Ser S Rum - Bul", "I figure if you bounce me in Con, that piffs the Russian fleet.", "Yeah, not bad. The danger is in Rumania. Are you thinking Gal - Ukr, Bud - Rum? Shall I order Tyr - Vie?\n\nI think that is likely best as it keeps Russia out of your centers for sure, and it should easy to support me out in the Fall once Russia has one less unit.", "Yep, that seems like the best course of action.", "So look, I\u2019m at your disposal in the east. I think the best bet may be for you to support me from Vienna to Galicia, but I\u2019m willing to do something else if you like something else better.", "Frankly, if I were you, I\u2019d be worried about a stab from Italy here. \ud83e\udd2d But I\u2019m not going to do that. You e been extremely good to me. And it would be a very bad time for me to begin a war in the east while all my units are west. So you\u2019re stuck with me as an ally.", "Yep, that all checks out, and I was thinking Vie-Gal was the best call, so let's make that happen.", "Well that is damn annoying. I\u2019m surprised he tried for Vienna \u2014 would have thought he would go for Rumania.", "I do think that we can guarantee you Sev this year, which should finally crack this nut.", "Yeah. I'd also like to address the center imbalance a bit more directly - as you pick up dots in the west, I'd like to start picking Greece, Vienna, and Ankara back up.", "Er, Smyrna, not Ankara.", "Totally agree.", "Yes, we need to take that in swiftly. Let\u2019s see what the builds look like and make a plan.", "Hi Austria \u2014 So, this is a big turn for us. I am absolutely committed to getting you a build. I wish we could get you more than one, but unfortunately the fact that you lost Vienna last turn makes that impossible. \n\nSo, it seems to me that the most important way to get you a build is to take Galicia in Spring. I don\u2019t care if I move there, or you move there, but we need to make some room around Budapest so that you can build there.", "Yeah, I'd appreciate your support from Bud-Gal.", "Maybe something like this:\nBud - Gal\nVie S Bud - Gal\nRum - Sev\nBLS S Rum - Sev\nArm S Rum - Sev\nBul - Rum\nSer - Bud\n\nIf the move to Gal does not work, and you don\u2019t get Sev, then in Fall you can order Bud - Tri while Vie and Ser bounce in Bud to ensure you get a build.", "Oh yeah that looks better than what I had in mind. Let's roll with that.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "One tweak: I am worried that Russia could take Rumania with the move set I proposed. You can prevent that by having Serbia support Bul - Rum. I think that\u2019s better than Ser - Bud, and it makes sense because you want Bud open after the Fall anyway. That should mean that you won\u2019t lose any ground this turn, and you\u2019ll likely take Sev.", "Oh yeah, good tweak, makes sense. So ordered.", "Hey \u2014 man, Russia keeps guessing correctly. I am sincerely sorry that that move did not work. \n\nThoughts on what to do this turn? I wish England or Germany would pick off a Russia. Center in the north, but they seem content to let Russia put up his road block.", "Use Tyrolia to tap Bohemia, Vienna supports Budapest to Galicia, and Rumania taps Ukraine. Unless Bohemia goes to Vienna, that guarantees a move to Galicia.", "Also, for my comfort, do you mind if I pick Trieste back up?", "I like that. I was thinking that you would move Bud back to Tri, but this is much better. It keeps forward momentum. And yes, you should take back Tri now. That will make builds easier as we move forward.", "Also, actually, I don't have anything for Bulgaria to do, and you're guaranteed two dots this turn. Can I take Greece back too? I can bank a build for the future regardless of what happens, and you stay even. You don't really need a build right now.", "Hmmm. I\u2019m cool with you taking Trieste. I\u2019m not sure that taking Greece now is the right move. \n\nIn the West, I will take Liverpool, but not Portugal. I need to use my Spanish fleet to support MAO so that I can convoy an army to Liverpool. And I\u2019m just in no hurry to take out France. So if you take Greece, you would be taking an Italian unit off the board and not building one yourself.", "Also, seems like there is plenty of risk that Russia could try for Rumania. Why not use Bulg to support Rum, while having Rum and BLS Support Arm to Sev?", "All that said, if you feel like you need to take two from me this turn in order to keep working with me, I can live with that.", "The alliance is much more important to me than the dot.", "I'll take another look at it and get back to you.", "Oh man. I\u2019m getting a lot of hate mail out west. Not fun. I think Germany has a pretty low opinion of me, and it sounds like she and Russia are developing a bit of a romance. \n\nI am totally cool with you taking back Trieste this turn, and I am thankful that you loaned it to me in the first place. But I\u2019d prefer if you wait to take Greece until you can actually use the build. It would make things quite a bit tougher for me if I have to take a unit off the board especially if we don\u2019t get an extra unit in the east to compensate.", "Yeah, if you're not picking up Portugal, then I'll let Greece be.", "Argh. I blew it!\n\nI\u2019m sorry. You were a terrific ally. I misread the board and thought that I had a clear solo run. England basically told me that he was going to help me solo, so I felt like I ought to just go for it. He bamboozled me, and for me to stab you. It was a mistake. My sincerest apologies.", "I mean, I'm gonna have to fight you for at least a little bit. We'll see what happens.", "Yeah, I get that. It makes me sick because it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll just get squeezed between me and Russia. Fighting me is not really a path toward viability for you, and that\u2019s my fault. \n\nI\u2019m sorry this happened. I really am. I misjudged the situation and I fear I\u2019ve ruined both our games. If you can stick around and insist on getting some of the fruits of smashing me and not letting Russia get them all, that would be justice.", "Oh, I'm definitely sticking around, and if you want to make it easier for me to pick up some dots, that'd go a long way to making me more viable and more inclined to resume the alliance.", "Good.", "I\u2019m game for a draw if you guys want to wrap it up here.", "I'd take a draw.", "Sounds like Germany is the holdout.", "I\u2019m so mad at myself for taking the bait last turn. I had both Russia and England urging me to go for a solo, and it was just stupid of me to believe them. \n\nI\u2019m going to try to leave both Tri and Bud open to you this turn. All yours.", "Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y\u2019all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would \u201cteach him\u201d and help his along to second place. Then y\u2019all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)", "(Part 2)\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I\u2019m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for \u201cHey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,\u201d but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that\u2019s really my preference. \n\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can\u2019t solo. And I\u2019m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I\u2019m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany\u2019s favor. \n\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.\ud83e\udd17", "I believe everyone is in for the draw.

I fully understand if it's too early to know, just know that channels and minds are both open .", "Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen Wintergreen. \n\nI\u2019m not writing to anyone else until I get things squared away with you. I LOVE the Wintergreen alliance. It works in the short-term (we only need to get A/T to fight) and it works in the long-term (resolves East before West, and we can\u2019t really stab each other). Can we do this?\n\nI don\u2019t care if we target T first or A first. I\u2019ll let you decide. But I want to work as your partner. I am just hoping that you\u2019re brilliant and fun too!\n\nI literally will not message anyone else until you and I have a plan. I want it to be clear to you that you\u2019re the ally I want.", "Well, Italy and France are, in my opinion, some of the best possible partners for Russia, so how could I possibly turn down such enthusiastic overtures from one of them?", "Lovely. Would you rather we target Turkey first or Austria? I\u2019m okay either way.", "To be perfectly honest, that's hard to say right now, since the decision doesn't really affect my opening moves any (the standard southern opening spring moves are equally useful against either one), and I'd likely need to adjust based on what else happens on the Spring turn.  Easiest just to say I'm opening South, flexibly considering the follow-through against either one of them.", "Okay. Fair enough. One reason it might matter is because I could open with an aggressive attack on Austria if you want to blitz him quickly (e.g., DMZ Gal and then break it). Or you could organize a bounce in Gal and then not move there. On the other hand, if you\u2019d prefer to take out Turkey first, I could go the standard Lepanto route. I\u2019m happy to go either way, but I\u2019d really like to coordinate with you if you\u2019re game.\n\nMaybe we both need a fuller picture of what is happening first. I\u2019ll begin to reach out to others now.", "Sounds great - and here's where it's useful to know Austria has already indicated a bounce in Galicia, so opportunity to blitz him through there is severely limited.", "Okay, that\u2019s good to know. Thank you. I sent Austria a general first message offering friendship. I\u2019ll let you know how things play out.", "Hearing anything interesting? Both Austria and Turkey are acting cagey and conservative with me so far.", "Hey, so, Austria seems to want to Lepanto now. \n\nYou\u2019re still the ally I want. And I\u2019d like either to cut down Austria quickly or cut down Turkey quickly. \n\nIf we decide to take out Austria first, I\u2019d like you to let Austria in to Gal (just tell him this was a mistake). This will make it very hard for him to defend against me.\n\nIf we decide to take out Turkey first, bounce Austria, and I\u2019ll open as a traditional Lepanto.\n\nThoughts?", "Let's do Turkey first. I'll bounce Galicia", "\ud83d\udc4c", "Hi Russia, how\u2019s it going? I hope this turn finds you well. \n\nI think my move is going to be fairly boring, but I\u2019m still game for some adventure if you have any ideas. \n\nAlso, would you mind asking Austria for a bounce again in Galicia? I\u2019d just like to have a decent sense of what his units are doing. \n\nAny other thoughts?", "Can do.", "He doesn't seem that interested in a Galicia bounce, fwiw", "Okay, thank you for letting me know. That helps!", "I believe that Turkey is in for a world of hurt soon. I think you just need to expel that yellow army from Sev, and you should be in for a swift turnaround. \n\nLet\u2019s kill Turkey, and then we kill Austria. Long live Wintergreen.", "That's the plan, mate", "That went reasonably well. Looks like Austria is going to pick up Greece, so get wherever you can get and I'll get you into doors where I can", "Obviously Bulgaria, not Greece", "Awesome. Thank you Russia. Any chance you can tap Black Sea this turn? I\u2019m planning to take Greece, but I need Austria\u2019s move to Bulgaria to succeed.", "His move is guaranteed", "What am I missing? It looks like it\u2019s only guaranteed if you tap BLS. Otherwise, 3 - 3.", "It's 4-3.  Rum, Ser, Gre, Aeg", "Ah, cool. I did not realize that Rum was supporting Gre to Bul. That works too! Thank you.", "Hi friend: can you please NOT support England into Denmark? I think that the last thing we want to see here is E/F trample over Germany. I feel like this is really important. Thoughts?", "Ah, I did not see this in time.  And one of the upshots was learning that England talks too damn much, so I probably won't be helping him much going forward \ud83d\ude03", "I feel like, perhaps it\u2019s time to go all out against both T and A here? Something like this:\nVen - Tri\nWar - Gal\nRum - BLS\nSev S Ukr - Rum\n\nI may lose Greece this year, but I feel like it\u2019s worth it to gain some momentum. \n\nThoughts?", "Hi Russia,\n\nMy moves very much depend on you here so I\u2019m looking forward to hearing from you. I think this is the right time for us both to hit Austria, but I\u2019m not going to do it if you\u2019re not on board. \n\nThoughts?", "Hey, sorry -focused on guests for the holiday. I'm currently ordered to move units around so I can move on Austria, without moving on him this turn. Basically getting the fleet out of the way.", "Okay. Let\u2019s shoot for next turn. Thank you!", "Russia, argh....\n\nI sincerely want to work with you man. Truly. But if you sell me out and try to use what I tell you against me, it makes it really hard. \n\nAustria went right back to me and told me that you sold me out.", "I want to move beyond this. But I need to know that what I tell you stays between us, or else I just can\u2019t trust you and I can\u2019t speak with you. \n\nI\u2019d like to hear your side of this story. And I\u2019d like to know that you\u2019re not just going to tell Austria again. Let\u2019s use this bump in the road as a lesson to work better together.", "Eh? Are you really claiming I've been telling him anything useful, given that I said nothing about Greece?\nI mean, that looked kinda arranged to me, but nonetheless I gave him no heads up about your plan to move in, which should make it pretty clear I have no intention of passing on potentially useful info to him. \ud83d\ude00", "So, where do we stand now?", "You're in the driver's seat for path forward. I'm going to take Ankara, I assume you've negotiated the taking of Smyrna.  Austria either needs to be given a path forward or dealt with, and England most likely needs dealt with. So... You have lots of options on path forward, and I'm mostly inclined to Ride along as most of my attention is likely to be in the North.", "Well, here is my honest assessment: if you want to work with me, you have to commit to attack Austria with me. If you\u2019re not interested in that, I\u2019m not going to attack Austria, and it will basically be his choice whether he wants to attack me next or attack you next.", "Frankly, I am still a little wary after the last time we discussed this, you ratted me out to Austria. But I can get over that if you actually want to be my partner.", "I'm still not really sure how you think I \"rated you out\" to Austria given that I've really told him nothing useful at all.  Greece was the test of that -even though I'm retrospect it's obvious it was an arrangement, it's also obvious I didn't say anything to him when I thought you were stabbing him", "But whatever, water under the bridge. I'm willing to move on Austria as soon as you give the word. I thought that's what I pretty much just said -I'll follow your lead in the South. You want to roll? Let's roll.", "Orders are in, moves on Austria, up to you to join in.", "What moves on Austria would you like to see, and what have you ordered? I\u2019ll make the move now if it makes sense. If not now, then next turn.", "Yeah, you missed me after I'd gone to bed, but as you can see I did make the move on him, and we are apparently spoiling for a fight.  Of course, with you reoriented the way you are, seems unlikely you're on board for continuing that line of discussion.", "Well, I\u2019m not completely opposed. I build an army in Venice, after all. What are you thinking?", "I mean, the only decision point is Ank/Smy/Con, right?  That's just a matter of choosing the mover - everything else is straightforward one-power tactics", "Well, we should really talk to each other more.", "Ya think?", "FWIW, I'm still on board with cooperating to take down Austria, if that wasn't obvious", "I\u2019m not sure I can save the Bulgarian fleet this turn, but I think you would help yourself by taking Galicia.", "I'm not sure you have a vested interest in saving my fleet in any event -you'd much rather be the undisputed fleet power. And that's just fine.", "Well, either way, I can\u2019t help. But I do think you can take Gal without problem.", "That was already the plan, and then he walked out anyway. \nAnyway, my course is both set and obvious, so it's really just a question of if you're going to take all the free dots. \ud83d\ude00", "Will you be around near the deadline this turn?", "Monday at noon ET?  Yeah, I should be available around that time.", "\ud83d\ude0e", "Hi Russia, still there?", "Russia!? Come back!", "Yes, I'm here", "Cool. Any chance you\u2019d like to team up with me and England?", "I mean, sure. My goal right now is just to hammer Austria, and that coalition helps further that goal, so...", "Cool. I expect Vienna will be empty this turn. Boh - Vie should be a winner.", "Ahh...BOH - Vienna. Why\u2019d you try to take it from Gal?", "Didn't log in fast enough to change it. And not really upset about it, either - this way my line is still mostly intact, which is a bit of a priority until you make an overtly anti-Austrian move.", "Fair enough. At least you can see that I was sincere.", "Aye. As was I. \ud83d\ude00", "So, how are things going over there Comrade?", "I\u2019m feeling like it\u2019s just about time for you and me to make things official and go steady.", "I believe that England would like me to support you to Munich in the Fall. And that\u2019s possible. But perhaps getting you to Budapest might work out better for you? I don\u2019t know \u2014 how do you the board right now?", "Things are pretty well. Yes, this looks to be the year you can just quietly slip the knife in and take pretty much everything.", "And I'm easy either way -no need to make that call right now, as this is the boring turn for me", "Well...if I \u201ctake everything,\u201d then we end up with a boring, large draw. I\u2019m not in solo position. So, believe it or not, I\u2019d rather you get the spoils out East. If I get much bigger, I\u2019ll be fighting the whole board, and I\u2019ll lose that fight.", "Well, damn, guess I can't bamboozle you into that position then. :)", "Eh \u2014 I think it\u2019s a better position for you to get a bunch of centers and work as a team anyway. Beats a five-way draw.", "Shall we get you Budapest or Munich this year?", "I think Austria is likely to try to retake some of his centers this year, so you may have some openings regardless.", "Presumably Budapest is the better option, but again I'm not really moving much in the spring, so it's easy to remain noncommittal on that right this moment. Unless you're making a hard move right now, which I doubt - you also benefit from the likely ability to just walk in on the fall.", "Alright, now it's specific planning time.  And Munich clearly doesn't seem to make much sense now.", "Okay, Let\u2019s get you into Rumania and Budapest this turn. I think I can do that, as Austria wants to take Trieste and Greece, which will open up room to maneuver. As far as I know, Ser is moving to Tri and Bul is moving to Gre. I think that you can take out Bud/Rum with Gal - Bud (supported by Vie) and Sev - Rum (supported by Ukr). The trick will be keeping Sev safe, but I think we can do that too, as I can recommend that Austria self-bounce there to keep me honest.", "I am picking up some gains out west, so I risk a severe backlash if I gain anything in the east.  I\u2019d love to see you pick up two here and take a bit of the pressure off me.", "I can work with that.  Grrr. Out tonight, so less stability to chat, but I'm with you here.", "\ud83d\udc4c", "Is this thing back on?", "Ah, good. Nice run in the West you have going there", "I'd probably be trying to push a stop the leader narrative right now, except Mitch hasn't talked to me since I pointed out that rolling on me was only going to net him two dots before he hit a wall, and that was two or three years ago. So... Eff him. \ud83d\ude00", "Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y\u2019all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would \u201cteach him\u201d and help his along to second place. Then y\u2019all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)", "(Part 2)\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I\u2019m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for \u201cHey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,\u201d but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that\u2019s really my preference. \n\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can\u2019t solo. And I\u2019m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I\u2019m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany\u2019s favor. \n\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.\ud83e\udd17", "I think most of us have the draw set already"], "sender_labels": [true, true, false,

You might want to ask about whether a fleet gets built in Mar during the 1901 build, if you haven't already, as this would be an indicator of aggression towards you.", "Germany seems like a bit of a wild card. Haven't talked in depth with Austria.", "Do you have any sort of aggression in your opening, or are you just planning to be neutral and secure Tun?", "You know, I really haven\u2019t decided. I\u2019m trying to get clear answers from my neighbors, and they are all pretty slow to answer. So I really haven\u2019t decided. Is there something you want me to do?", "Well definitely make sure you get your fleet to Tun by the fall. I'd like to see you do well, as Italy is kind of the underdog on the map. Have you agreed to France about Piedmont at all?", "No, we have not yet talked about Piedmont.", "Well, if you're looking to make France a little nervous, that would be your move. Ven - Pie, Rom - Ven, Nap to TYS.", "Then you secure Tun with your fleet in the fall. For the unit in Pie, you can decide to bait France into a bounce in Mar, but then just hold instead. France would move from Spain to Mar and miss securing the fifth supply center. This is certainly aggressive, but it also keeps you and France on a more level playing field.", "Well, I\u2019d be inclined to do that if I knew you were moving to the Channel and Wales. If you want for both of us to go all in at the same time, then let\u2019s go.", "Yeah, that makes sense. Unfortunately we've declared a DMZ in the channel through 1902, so I can't commit to the stab right now. I still don't think it's an awful play for you. If France gets a fleet in Mar and has one parked in Spain s.c. at the start of 1902, that's going to be a little threatening for you.", "(1) If you\u2019ve declared a DMZ, then you ARE in position to do this if you want to do it. (2) I\u2019m not going to attack France on my own.", "Yeah, everything you're saying makes sense. When I make specific agreements like the DMZ, I generally try to hold them, especially early game. Honestly, I'd rather the three of us pick apart germany to start. Maybe we could convince France to help you into Munich in the Fall?", "Hi England \u2014 just sort of checking in to hear how things are going. How does the board look to you right now?", "Great time to check in. France and Germany are in conflict, and don't seem poised to collaborate on invading me, which I'm happy about. Russia's looking a little troubled with losing Sev. You look poised to lepanto to turkey, and it looks like you'll pull it off without the Austrian convoy, unless that new fleet is headed west. Also, I feel like you and/or Austria may have your eyes on Munich.", "Any thoughts here?", "Just about the state of the board? Or did you send a message after mine that didn\u2019t come through?", "Ah, I sent a really long message about Germany. You didn\u2019t get it?", "Nah. Maybe it was a bot-killer message", "Probably best to split it up", "Rats.", "Here is an image of the message I sent.", "I\u2019ve been on pins and needles for two days awaiting a response!!!", "Haha sorry about that. No image received. The bot may not send them through", "Ahhhhhhh!", "Now I have to retype it\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e", "I have kind of an odd favor to ask. And I happen to know it\u2019s in your best interest, but it will require a big picture, long-term sort of view of the game. \n\nThis is Germany\u2019s very first game of Diplomacy. And he\u2019s clearly in over his head. You\u2019re positioned to smash him. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But the real winner if you do that is France. (End part 1)", "France has FOUR armies, and now he has a wide open runway to roll right over Germany. If you help him, you\u2019re going to regret it. Look two game years ahead, France is going to be in a crazy good position. \n\nOn the other hand, if you change course now and go get France instead, France is NEVER going to be able to build a second fleet. He will be so much easier to destroy. And Germany is so green...he\u2019ll be much easier to take down second. \n\nI just...I can see where this is headed. I know it\u2019s attractive just to take that easy build. But that is the apple of knowledge and France is the devilish serpent (end part 2)", "I really REALLY believe that it\u2019s better for you and me for you to switch course and take out France now. I\u2019d be happy to help and give you most of the spoils. And I think this would be a great springboard for a dominant England/Italian alliance that can win this game. If only I could get this message to go through....\n(End)", "All of this is fair. I\u2019m aware that germany\u2019s a first-timer, and I ran through similar reasoning to yours when trying to choose who to side with.", "If I had known where you stood in this, it might have swayed my opinion. I was worried about you and austria making a play for Munich and then Russia applying more pressure in the north.", "One additional piece of my reasoning is that France is a stronger player than me and others probably know this. After Germany is gone, France is the bigger threat. If Germany and I had taken France together, I would have ended up the bigger threat (i.e. the next target).", "I\u2019m going to get Russia in on the German takedown. You really think the three of us can\u2019t handle france together once germany is gone?", "Can you tell germany to self-bounce in ruhr? Unless i\u2019m missing something, that line holds until i support into holland (which I haven\u2019t been asked to do yet). The French upside to taking on germany can be contained. If you get Munich out of this, do you still think it\u2019s a bad plan?", "I vehemently do not want Munich.", "Also i\u2019m wayy wrong it\u2019s a fleet in holland haha", "I do think it is a much better plan for both of us to side with Germany against France. I just think that France could pull in Austria or Turkey against me and he could pull in Russia against you. \n\nGermany won\u2019t do that sort of counter.", "The more I look at this board, the more I want to focus on an E/I Alliance. And I think the only thing standing in our way is France. I don\u2019t see Germany as any kind of obstacle at all.", "Especially given that France is locked into armies right now, not fleets, I think we would be wasting a real opportunity if we let France grow a bit more.", "I\u2019m sorry I did not come to you with this earlier. That\u2019s just my bad. I\u2019ve been kind of lazy, and I wasn\u2019t really sure I wanted to weigh in about the west at all. But, I\u2019ve changed my mind?\n\nI think E/I can dominate here. But we\u2019ve got to keep France from ever building a second fleet. I think that\u2019s the way that both you and me get really big.", "I see your points, but a couple of things: 1) France has another build guaranteed this year, and that will likely be a fleet, 2) We may be able to keep France away from all of the German supply centers", "Kie and Mun bounce in Ruh, Hol cuts support from Bel. This holds Ruh unless France chooses to send Bel in and let Germany into Holland.", "This holds the line unless I give support.", "What if Austria gets Munich?", "I stabbed Germany, and so I\u2019m hesitant to try collaboration now.", "Ok, ok. I\u2019m open to going against france. I messaged germany. We\u2019ll see how she responds. I\u2019m taking denmark this year regardless. The stab on france would involve me taking the channel unexpectedly next spring and helping germany into belgium maybe", "These are all good responses. And I get that you don\u2019t want to turn around and stab France now. \n\nI do think that I can help you diplomatically with Germany. I think that, if you really want to work with me and Germany, I can get G on board.", "Alright, well we can chat next year after builds then. I\u2019m certainly open to it. I told germany to not bother saving denmark (it\u2019s guaranteed for me with Russian support) amd instead do the self bounce in Ruh with Kei and Mun to keep France out, cutting support in Bel with Hol. I think that move is important this fall to keep France out.", "France just tried to tell me the Brest build was anti-Italian haha", "Funny enough, he tells me it\u2019s anti-English.", "Haha. So are we still both anti-French?", "I\u2019d like to get germany on board with helping me take the channel (or at least not stopping me). I\u2019m sure germany would be excited to hit me back though :/. I\u2019ll play dumb with France for now", "Okay, I\u2019ll try to get Germany on board.", "Germany seems on board. Maybe i\u2019m setting myself up to get stabbed. Hope i\u2019m backing the right horse on this one. I\u2019ll shoot for the channel in the spring and then we get germany into belgium. Are you planning to move west?", "Was hoping to see something a little more anti-french in your moves. My homeland is toast if you don\u2019t put any pressure on France in the south.", "Hi England \u2014 I\u2019m sorry for the delay!", "I can move to attack France in the Spring if you like. For now, I think that mobilizing Germany to attack France is your best bet (and shouldn\u2019t be too hard).", "You know what? This isn\u2019t really fair of me. If you will commit to the France attack, I\u2019ll move on him now. Are you ready to go all out against him? This could actually work out really well for both of us.", "I\u2019m ready, but i may want your advice on some of the tactics. My plan is to completely cold shoulder France in negotiations and start an attack. We\u2019ll want to get germany on board, but I think Germany is playing a bit neutral for survival purposes right now.", "I agree with regard to Germany\u2019s strategy, but I believe he hates France most and he will be with you if both you and I move on France now. \n\nFrance is getting no builds. Let\u2019s just put the clamps on now! I will move to TYS and Tun if you will move either to take Belgium, or to position your fleets at Irish/Channel. \n\nIf we both take the plunge, there is nothing he can do.", "France can support himself into England though, and I think he plans to because he was asking for Germany to cut support in Nth (which she plans not to). The only way to hold the channel is to support from Nth.", "into England => into English channel", "I'm planning army yorkshire to wales, which allows for the convoy through the channel next year, and allows me to bounce in Lvp if France moves to IRI", "Okay, I buy that. If you commit to moving the army to Wales and you don\u2019t attack Germany,  I\u2019ll move on France.", "I'm committed. Are you planning to cut support in Munich for a Russian invasion of Berlin?", "No way. I am supporting Munich. We don\u2019t want Russia or France rolling over Germany. Germany will give us her centers in time. Let\u2019s keep them German until that time comes.", "Can you use Den to cut support in Baltic if I make sure Germany does not retake Den?", "Germany has to do something else with Munich? To protect Ruhr I guess?", "go team!", "Cool. Let\u2019s do this.", "Are you LYO and WES this Spring with the fleets? And will Venice go to Pie? Also, what is your communication with France like? I'm in favor of all three of us going totally dark on France until the job is done. And at some point we should talk about a fair split of the French supply centers just so there's no surprises.", "Yes, those are my moves.", "And I don\u2019t have any dialogue with France right now. I suppose that\u2019s lazy. You want me to stay quiet or try to feel him out? There is no way he will believe anything I say after my last move.", "I kind of want to starve him of info. I\u2019m currently giving him radio silence. Germany is getting some inside info, pretending to be friendly, etc. but that will end shortly (assuming I don\u2019t see a surprise german stab of cutting the nth channel support, but i think it\u2019s unlikely).", "France apparently plans to move out of Ruh, probably to defend the south. France will lose 1 supply center certainly, maybe 2 this year", "What are your thoughts on a divvy up of you in Mar and Spa, me in Bre and Por, and germany in Bel and Par? Just thinking long term about who gets what.", "Thanks for that info about France. \n\nAlso, Germany has confirmed to me that they trust you. I think you\u2019re right that there will be no German stab coming this turn.", "As far as that divide, that generally sounds fair. Though, I find that those kinds of agreed splits rarely come to pass exactly as proposed. I may have to turn around and go east if Austria stabs me, etc.", "So I\u2019d prefer to kind of focus on general principles: (1) I\u2019d like for the dominant alliance on the board to be E/I. So while I agree we want Germany to help us crack this but, longer term I think we should plan to divide Germany\u2019s share too. The safest divide in that case might leave me with all of Iberia, while you get most of Germany (I.e., you\u2019re going to need armies).", "(2) We should focus on parity. In other words, if I\u2019m way ahead on centers when France folds, you get more of France. If it\u2019s the opposite, I get more. We just keep checking in and try to balance both centers and growth opportunities, and let that guide us.", "All of that makes sense. We\u2019ll reevaluate as we go. I\u2019d like the promise of Belgium and Paris to Germany to be a consistent one that comes from both of us, for the purpose of maintaining German confidence in our alliance. In case germany asks you.", "Looks like you\u2019ve got a bit of a guessing game on your hands.", "Yep. Was hoping for a guarantee. \ud83e\udd28", "Germany and I were thinking to go with Spain. France is annoyed enough with me that he honestly may go for the channel. I\u2019ll be risking the channel by supporting ruh to bel with nth. So you can support to spain and then let france into mar from bur instead of bouncing. Germany will try to sneak into bur from Mun, then you two could bounce in Mun to keep russia out. A little complicated, but germany in bur next year would be great for us.", "Even if things don\u2019t go our way this fall, france will go eventually. Though the longer france has to stay alive, the longer he\u2019ll have to sweet-talk germany into turning on us", "Trieste? What's up with that?", "I guess it shows commitment to an English-Italian alliance, but I'm a little surprised to see a stab like that this soon.", "Not a stab. Austria offered it to me for the sake of parity.", "Hmmm, maybe I was supposed to keep that a secret? I think you need to give Austria some \u201cthumbs down\u201d", "Can you please not go to Austria and tell him that I said the move to Trieste was arranged? He\u2019s obviously trying to manipulate you in some way. Can we just compare notes and try to figure out what he\u2019s up to without revealing that you and I talk much?", "I'm not going to right now, but I also am a little curious why it would matter to you if I told Austria that. Are you telling Austria things like \"I really want the Austria-Italy alliance to be the dominant one on the board\"? What is your long-term plan with Austria?", "No \u2014 I just want to know what he\u2019s up to. It\u2019s not a big deal to me, but I didn\u2019t know he was going to try to pass that off as him getting stabbed, so I\u2019m curious what he\u2019ll tell you next. If you blow him up for lying to you, we won\u2019t get that info, and he\u2019ll know that you and I talk a lot.", "In terms of what I am telling Austria, I am definitely close with him, and I want him to feel like I\u2019m not going to stab him, but we\u2019re almost to the mid game, and cross board alliances work a lot better than neighbor alliances once we get to the mid-game, so I think you can be confident that you\u2019re the long-term ally I want.", "That said, I\u2019m definitely saying nice things to Austria too. I won\u2019t deny that. Not the same nice things, but I can\u2019t have Austria thinking I will attack him. That doesn\u2019t help me and I don\u2019t think it helps you.", "All of that makes sense. I won't call out Austria. How do you plan to continue your attack on France this year?", "I don\u2019t know. Is there something you\u2019d like me to do? I\u2019m rather flexible. I\u2019d just really like to bust through for a build this year.", "Thoughts?", "Would you like to support me to MAO?", "Won't France just cut in Bre?", "I'd actually like MAO next year.", "I'd like to hear something about your plans before midnight", "What do you need to know? I won\u2019t move to MAO, I\u2019ll try for Spain or Marseilles. Do you want to know more than that?", "Have you been talking to France at all?", "Nope. Not a word this phase.", "Huh. I guess France is lying to me then?", "Yes. I haven\u2019t said a word to him. What\u2019s he saying?", "France is a snake.", "Umm that you're the highest ranked online player in the world. And that you consistently encouraged him to attack me.", "Well that\u2019s fun. Um, where to begin? \n\nI think I\u2019m a good online player. I\u2019ve been playing online for about two years. I have a site ranking on one website in the Top 100, and I have a site ranking on another website in the top 250. So, maybe if you combine those rankings and squint, I\u2019d be in the top 200 or so?", "Also, I don\u2019t know who France is. So, he either has me confused with someone, or else he\u2019s just trying to scare you. Let\u2019s see...why would he be trying to scare you?", "And, I have definitely encouraged him to attack you, as I recall, but it\u2019s been several game years since then. I feel like you\u2019ve probably encouraged France to attack me before (a fairly natural thing for England to do).", "Bottom line: France has every reason in the world to try to get us to distrust each other, and he\u2019s obviously willing to say whatever to make that happen.", "I think I\u2019ve been really honest with you, and I think we\u2019ve been helpful to each other, and I think we are both going to succeed in this game if we can stick together and not give in to his tricks.", "Cause snakes are gunna snake.", "\ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\udc0d \ud83d\udc0d", "All of this pretty much lines up with what I expected, though it\u2019s nice to hear from you. He says that you\u2019re \u201c[redacted]\u201d on playdiplomacy.com . So I guess the user name lining up is just a coincidence. Not that I really care that much btw, but it would be interesting if you were secretly a star player.", "I\u2019ve never played on playdiplomacy. I play mostly on an app called Conspiracy. \n\nBut don\u2019t get me wrong! I\u2019m experienced, and I\u2019ve had some success. I\u2019m not to be trifled with!", "Also, you should be able to see from my moves, and Austria\u2019s, that I\u2019ve been telling you the truth.", "Yeah, that's fair. France is funny. I've gotten maybe 15 messages from France since I ghosted him. Is it rock, paper, or scissors against him this season?", "From France: \"I can stop Italy this turn by the way. It's pretty easy since Italy let me into Marseilles, I can support the hold in Marseilles and Marseilles can support MAO to Spain SC. It's impossible to breach, I've checked it, and I can keep making those orders for years and years. You stabbed me in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. I think that you, Italy, and Germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Italy. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples. We wait until AI crumbles, and you have an excellent game where you top the board.\"", "So I have my interpretation of the message, but I'm curious to hear yours", "Hmmm, thanks for sending that. I mean, obviously the orders he proposes can be defeated by tapping Marseilles and supporting into Spain. He knows we know that. He\u2019s just playing games and trying to throw us off.", "Yeah. Maybe it's not even worth thinking about. It's like the Sicilian in princess bride", "Exactly", "I\u2019m just going to flip a coin.", "So I guess you won't go for MAO then?", "Correct.", "(also, there's a couple other points I'd like to cover while I have you here)", "Ok that sounds good. I'm eyeing that for next spring.", "Sure.", "Well, I'm surprised you haven't been opinionated at all about my actions in Russia.", "Hmmm, well, I do have opinions. I just don\u2019t want to be overbearing.", "What are you thinking over there?", "The builds are tempting, but I don't want to be the one that hands austria the game", "What are your opinions?", "I'm going to bed. But other things I want to talk about are 1) the anti-English moves from Germany, 2) what you're doing with the Tyr unit.", "Responding now.", "You are thinking about the right considerations re Russia/Austria. Every build is enticing, but you have to consider the cost. Right now, Russia is basically using all of his units to help you. So, I think you might be better off foregoing that build and keeping Russia on your side for now.", "But...I certainly have no horse in that fight.", "If you want to attack Russia, no need to hold back on my account.", "I do want you to grow so that you and I are the same size. And those Russian centers will be key to that. But they also aren\u2019t going anywhere. I don\u2019t think there is any rush, personally.", "The Russian units are doing things you want them to do right now.", "Re Germany, I hadn\u2019t really noticed the anti-English moves. She keeps telling me that y\u2019all are very close.", "I feel pretty confident that she\u2019s with you, and that she really wants to see France out of the game.", "Re Tyrolia, what would you like me to do? I do have a plan with that unit. And if you wanted to deal a blow to Austria, I can think of at least one devious plan to make his turn go poorly.", "All that makes sense and I believe it. I feel like your \"horse\" in the russian front is Austria's future strength, which could pose a threat to you. Your advice to me is consistent with that.", "Yeah, that\u2019s true. I just don\u2019t want to be too nosy or high maintenance, really.", "I could see you feeling like you need to get some builds promptly, and so you pick off a Russian unit or two. Even though that may make my situation tougher, I feel like your cooperation against France and later Germany means too much to me for me to try to dictate what you do with Russia.", "I hope that makes sense.", "But my advice about what you should do really is my opinion about the best way to approach it from your perspective. I don\u2019t think you need to be in a hurry there. I think that just about every place on the board is moving in a positive direction for you right now, and so, if I were you, I would not want to shake that up.", "But if you do want to do that, it\u2019s very much okay with me.", "Yeah I'm not going for Russia right now. Supposing he can hold the stalemate, he's literally just saving those territories for me to take at a later date. I will get a little annoyed if the admin cuts us off at 1910 though, as I think my endgame is a little past that.", "The anti-english moves aren't strictly anti-english. But a fleet build in Berlin and then moving to Kie is a little aggressive.  Germany hoped I would just give up denmark this fall, and that was her explanation of the kie move. Eventually that Kie fleet will be going against me. A stab right now from germany doesn't seem to make much sense though.", "It would have to be coordinated with france to even have a chance, and with the pressure you're putting in the south I don't know how France could afford that. Unless he's really pissed at me and goes for a kamikaze just to annoy me.", "And what devious thing could you do with Tyr that wouldn't immediately begin aggressions with austria?", "Ok now I'm really going to bed. But I can think of a Tyr move that would really stir up some trouble. I wonder if we're thinking of the same one.", "Any chance you are around this morning?", "What\u2019s up?", "I don\u2019t want to tell Russia a way to deal Austria a blow because Russia will turn around and tell Austria. But I trust you, so I think I could pass on some info to you and you might not use it against me.", "Gotcha. What are the moves you\u2019re thinking?", "You might say something like this to Russia:\n\nI was chatting with Italy about Tyrolia, and he told me that he promised to use Tyrolia to help Austria. My best guess is that Tyrolia and Galicia will bounce in Vienna. If you just use Bohemia to support Tyrolia in, then Austria doesn\u2019t get a build and you likely break up Italy and Austria.", "Too devious? \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2b", "I'd considered this move as something that russia could do to free up Gal, but I think I thought Ser was a home center or something, so I didn't realize the build consequence.", "I'd bet russia is already planning to do this, but I can make the suggestion", "I did have a different move for Tyr in mind.", "Oh yeah?", "This is not a good idea, i should clarify. But it would be very dramatic if you successfully supported Boh to Mun", "(also I have a feeling russia won't be online before noon unfortunately)", "well, russia had the right idea, but didn't choose the right one to support. Bounce in Ank planned? And congrats on Mar", "Yes, both bounces planned. Russia made a nice gamble taking Bulgaria.", "Even with Austria in BLA now? I'll be a little annoyed if I see a build in St. P", "Yeah, for sure. Austria loses that build and keeps Vienna vacant. Russia GETS a build. Yeah, I think that worked well for Russia.", "We should start talking about the France endgame and what things look like post-war. Maybe after we see the French choice for a disband. I think France hates me the most (despite me having taken none of his territories) and as a result will probably hold onto Brest until the end, or maybe even go for LVP or something.", "Sure \u2014 I\u2019m happy to talk it through. That move by France to bounce NAO was annoying.", "Yeah, I kinda saw that coming. So things are kinda escalating with germany. She\u2019s making lots of asks that I don\u2019t think are reasonable. Like \u201cwhy not just give me denmark\u201d and \u201cwhy not just leave Nth open\u201d. She\u2019s also admitted to being friendly with France.", "Yeah, I\u2019m hearing rumblings of the same thing from Germany. Just sort of feeling me out on whether I\u2019d be okay with her working with France. Not good.", "How would you like to address it with moves this turn? Do you want me to support you to MAO? Or should I move there?", "How has she suggested to you that she\u2019ll be helping France? Because if she\u2019s telling you that, it must mean working with france against me, maybe with something specific in mind. She also wants me to give up Brest haha. Maybe i\u2019ll ask if she wants London", "I don\u2019t know anything specific. She\u2019s just asking for my thoughts. I have not responded.", "Though, I\u2019m not surprised. France is not going to quit. He hasn\u2019t been talking to me anymore and he hasn\u2019t been trying to turn you. That means he\u2019s been working on Germany. I think we just have to keep telling her that France is a Dark Wizard who does not have her best interest in mind.", "Yeah, I mean good on France for being persistent. I'm sure France is telling her that we're allies. And that would actually be the truth. And just geographically it would be hard for me and germany to be allies longer-term, so it's somewhat understandable that Germany could be swayed by that logic.", "What are your thoughts on the timing of war with Germany (if you're keen on a war in the near future at all)? I have an idea of how to handle the situation that's slightly dependent on that", "Well, I don\u2019t really want to attack Germany this year. In a perfect world, you and I each get a build this year, and we are in position to attack Germany next year.", "Germany seems to like my advice, so I may be able to get her to take Paris this year and refrain from attacking you. If we can cripple France in the next two turns, without Germany attacking, then next year\u2019s attack on Germany would be easy.", "That is my general thinking in it.", "I mean I don't see how I get a build this year outside of moving in on Russia, but I'd rather stay out for now. Honestly the worst that Germany can do this year is knock me out of the channel.", "So I don't want support into MAO this turn. I might reach out to France with a proposition for survival that I won't follow through with. But maybe I can make it convincing enough that he gives it a shot. Otherwise I'm rather nervous that France gives Germany a big hand with attacking my island in his final years", "Also, will an attack on Germany really be easy next year?", "Also, did you tell germany i was plotting against her? She says you did.", "Whoa \u2014 no, I want you and Germany to work together.", "I would not and have not said you are plotting against her. She floated the \u201cwork with France thing,\u201d and I suggested that she should really take Paris now while she can.", "If we can get Germany to take Paris, next year will be much easier. I think we should both direct her there.", "You really said nothing to that effect? What would prompt france to say that to me? It\u2019s ok if you did say something, but i want you to be honest about it.", "Some exciting moves. Will be curious to see where you stand.", "Hey \u2014 sorry I\u2019ve been offline since the bot went down. That looks like a pretty aggressive move from Germany. I wonder if France has pocketed her. I do like the move to Paris, but the rest is not good.", "Yeahh. It\u2019s a shame. I mean i\u2019m aware at this point that the two of you could choose to mow over me. I hope the expanse in northern russia makes you wary of helping germany though.", "Time for survival mode. Will appreciate some advice on tactics if you\u2019re on my side of this.", "Yeah, I\u2019m on your side. I\u2019ll help on tactics, but I think the real key here is getting Germany to flip back. I don\u2019t see why that move has to be permanent. I think you should tell her something like this: \u201cLook, I see that you are attacking you, but I think it\u2019s my fault not yours. I should have given you back Denmark. I see that now. And I\u2019m sorry. I will move out peaceably, and I hope we can work out a new working relationship.\u201d", "Just say you\u2019re sorry. She can take it back anyway, might as well offer it back right?", "(And I\u2019m not saying you have anything to be sorry for, I\u2019m just trying to brainstorm about what will help you turn her back to your side.)", "I already responded non-angrily, though not specifically what you said. I think a return of denmark could go a long way. Though that border will make things tense, and i don\u2019t think peace with her could last forever", "One thing I'm curious about: Why would you want Germany and I to be friends? Aren't you better off with both of us fighting? And I can keep Denmark this fall if I give up the channel (which may fall anyways)", "Well, I want to be rid of France. I\u2019ve really been depending on the two of you to help in that project. If England decides to move out of Paris for France, that\u2019s bad for me. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t want to see Germany get two builds this turn. But you\u2019re right, if it\u2019s inevitable anyway, it\u2019s not the end of the world. \n\n#teamengland", "I sure hope you\u2019ve not been clicking that thumbs down haha. It would be a brutal stab. I suppose i\u2019ve got to place my trust somewhere though. Why choose me instead of germany?", "You know, if you're able to lend a hand from MAO, I'm actually not in THAT bad of shape. Can I depend on that?", "1) You\u2019ve been straight with me all game. 2) You have a much better ability to read the board than she does. 3) You\u2019re on the other side, so you can\u2019t really stab me, but I could totally see her moving to Tyrolia some time soon. 4) You\u2019re not in France\u2019s pocket.", "All good reasons. Also, I think Germany is gonna ghost me, soooo, friends? I need MAO to attack Bre. Can you do that?", "I will ensure that Brest can\u2019t hurt you. Not sure yet if I\u2019ll cut that support or get France to do something weird with it, but you can consider that unit non functional this turn. I\u2019ll also see what intel I can gain.", "Cool. You really think you can get france to take your advice on Brest?", "And do you have opinions about russia walking into Mun?", "Re Brest: if I\u2019m not confident, I\u2019ll just cut that support. I know that one is important to you, and I\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s taken care of.", "Re Munich: that one never really crossed my mind. But if you can get Russia to do that, it would be awesome. I don\u2019t want to see Germany get builds here.", "Cool. Any advice on the rest of tactics for my defense? I have my own ideas, but would be curious to hear your opinion", "I\u2019d probably just use the army to protect Liverpool. I\u2019d send NAO to Norwegian if the battle is going to be against Germany. And I\u2019d flip a coin between supporting Channel to Belgium or supporting Denmark holding.", "And I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone the result of that coin flip. There is just no reason to share that info.", "Huh. That's way different than what I had in mind.", "Well, you\u2019re closer to it than I am. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve taken a much harder look. What am I missing?", "You're not missing anything, but I had a more defensive strategy in mind I guess. I've got some time to think it over. Please do let me know what intel you receive", "Hi, I have a different ask of the MAO unit actually, if you're around this morning.", "Hey \u2014 what\u2019s up?", "I want to see whether supporting channel to Bre is an option for MAO you'd consider. And I'd also want to know if Gas support will be cut.", "Well, have to just be honest here \u2014 I\u2019ve been working on a larger plan considering your earlier request that I neutralize Brest, and I\u2019m not sure that change works in the larger scheme.", "More broadly, is there any chance you\u2019d like to form a trio and work with me and Russia long term?", "Why wouldn't you let me in on your larger plan?", "And does your larger plan include neutralizing Brest, or did it just consider that I asked that? Can you confirm you're neutralizing Brest by attacking it from MAO?", "Yes, hitting Brest. \n\nI prefer not to share my moves if they don\u2019t matter to someone else. There is just less chance that something goes wrong, and less chance I end up blaming someone else if something goes wrong.", "What do you think about E/I/R as a trio?", "I think you need to justify to me why supporting into Brest isn't an option. I don't see how this could be relevant to some larger plan. Unless the plan is \"don't give England that build, don't show others that I'm supporting England\"", "Wow. Well, you asked me to do something else earlier, and I have spent days trying to fit your earlier request into my move set.", "But, you know what, it\u2019s more important to me to have you as an ally. So I\u2019ll support you to Brest.", "I obviously would like that. But to be honest I care less about the support and more about the secret.", "So, confirmed, MAO supporting Channel to Brest.", "Test.", "It\u2019s not a secret. It\u2019s just that I like to keep my moves secret unless they matter to someone.", "Can you confirm whether support from Gas is cut as well?", "I am not currently cutting support in Gascony.", "Ok. And I'm down to chat about russian relations after the move. Sorry for the last-minute change here. But germany's been putting pressure on me", "Have to say \u2014 I expect Germany to use Paris to support Brest. Those two seem to be in lockstep now.", "Are you sure that I should just take Portugal to drop England down to 1 unit?", "I mean drop France down to 1 unit.", "France is just going to bounce you out, right? What else does it make sense for the Spa unit to do?", "He thinks I am supporting an attack on Spain and moving to Burgundy, so I think his moves look like this:\n\nSpain hold\nGas S Spa holding\nParis S Brest\nBrest S MAO - Channel (he asked me to take it)\nIrish - Liv", "Hmm, yeah I would have thought he would assume the Gas support would be cut. Does France really hate you the least?", "Yeah, I think France trusts that I\u2019m actually going to Channel and Burgundy here.", "I will admit I've communicated with Germany about your plan to use MAO to help me. That may have made its way back to France", "I feel like you, Germany, and France: if I tell anyone anything, it circulates to all three.", "Yeahh. I maybe should keep my mouth shut more often.", "Germany says that the Brest thing relates to Denmark. \n\nAnyway, what should we do?", "It does. I'm giving up denmark for support to Brest.", "Okay, I\u2019ll support you to Brest.", "Sounds great", "Thanks", "Glad to see that go through.", "Told you about the move to Por btw", "You were right. Thank you.", "Well I'm glad to see the takedown work out. I suppose France has one more unit, but Por will fall next year. And now things get even more interesting. Signing off for now.", "Hmmm, interesting French disband. He wants me to support him to Brest. Have to believe he\u2019s going to have Germany on his side given the German fleet build. \n\nThoughts on how to approach this? We should be able to defeat them if we stick together.", "I think we should focus on getting your army to Pic this turn, and I can support you to Paris in the Fall.", "DO NOT DISCUSS PLANS WITH GERMANY THIS TURN. Seems very clear that she\u2019s coming for you based on the build and the French disband. I don\u2019t think we help ourselves by speaking with her. Let\u2019s just get you into Paris, secure North Sea, and get moving.", "I don\u2019t need any builds in the North. If I get bigger, I\u2019ll have a target on my back. So I\u2019m just going to help you get up to my level.", "Also, I need to decide to work with Russia or Austria in the East. What\u2019s your preference?", "I'll be in communication with Germany, but I'll agree to not share any specific plans discussed between the two of us this turn. Is that fair?", "Yes of course. I don\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t talk to her at all.", "At first glance, I prefer an alliance with Russia, though I understand this means you breaking a relationship with Austria. Mostly this is because Russia can threaten me if he ever goes north. What's your preference?", "Well, that\u2019s fine with me. I like Russia. But here is the downside for you: if Russia grows, the north won\u2019t be undefended any more, and you will have less room to grow. So, think long term, and think about where your dots are going to come from. I mean it sincerely when I say that I\u2019ll join up with either one provided you feel good about it, but I actually think it might be better for you if I give back Austria a couple of centers and position you to grab Swe and STP once Germany is on her heels.", "Those are good points. I suppose you'd like to commit to this before moves this evening?", "*commit one way or the other", "Yeah, I think we should make a plan.", "I\u2019d like to have your final thoughts on A/R as quickly as possible so that I have time to execute a plan. But I understand if you want time to think about it.", "How is Germany treating you right now? Did she tell you about that fleet build before it happened? Seems like a bad sign, and North Sea is awfully exposed.", "Oh she told me that she plans to line the whole northwest coast with fleets because \"they're more versatile there\". But all they can do from the northwest coast is invade me.", "She also said she wants Brest eventually.", "Not sure if I can keep Nth this year. We'll see if I can keep it friendly. That involves lots of talk about moving against you. She wants to see me in MAO.", "Yeah, look, I don\u2019t mind if you tell her that you\u2019re moving against me. I am telling her that I\u2019m moving against you. \n\nLet\u2019s please make the following deal: You and I both plot with Germany as if we\u2019re attacking each other. And we both share the plan with Germany against the other guy with each other, and we pledge to tell Germany (and France if he asks) that you and I are not talking much, we don\u2019t trust each other, and we don\u2019t have any plan in place.", "This turn will work best if we share all info that we learn from G/F, and we pledge to keep our own talks secret.", "I think that we can pull off a great turn, but it won\u2019t work if G/F get catch wind of our alliance.", "All that makes sense. I'm on board. You know, if Germany just stopped surprising me with aggressive moves, she may have won my favor. [sigh]", "And I think Austria is the ally we choose. If we hold off Germany, she can only expand into Russia, which would be her only friend. And the trusting relationship you have makes it more likely that things will go through.", "\ud83d\udc4c", "So, here is the plan that Germany is telling me:\n\nShe wants to ensure she gets North Sea. So she is asking for this:\n\nDen S Bel - North\nBel - North\nHol - Bel\nPic - Channel\nSpa - Gas\nPar S Sap - Gas\nMAO - Irish", "She wanted me to support her direct from Paris to Brest, but I convinced her that you would likely fear a forced disband, so you were likely to try to keep me out of Gascony (thus Par S Spa - Gas).", "I don\u2019t think we can save North Sea this turn, but if we can land your army in Pic, we can force France to retreat to Belgium, which would be absolutely awesome. And I think his survival instinct would kick in at that point, and he would stay there until you take it.", "I may be able to save Nth with some diplomacy. Is it worth me trying to make Germany a hard case to be on my side? Does that just make her moves less predictable?", "So I would suggest this:\nBre S Wal - Pic\nWal - Pic\nChannel Convoy Wal - Pic\n\nThat means Germany will lose Paris and Belgium this year. And I think you can defend your territory even with G in North Sea.", "I really think that we are best off not suggesting that you and I are talking. If Germany gets any idea that I shared her plans with you, we\u2019ll have no idea what they are going to do.", "Uhh, Germany will just hop into one of my home centers from Nth in the fall...", "I trust you at this point, but I don\u2019t think that confronting her is the best move here.", "No, you can defend.", "Oh move  to Cly?", "Oh wait Nth just  retreats. whoops", "You can move NAO to Norwegian in Spring, and retreat North to Norway. Then in Fall you cover London with Channel while I support you to Paris.", "Right.", "So you have coverage for every center, and you get the build, while G loses two.", "Thoughts on a retreat to Hel?", "That\u2019s the best I can come up with if G is being honest with me.", "I would not be opposed to a retreat to Hel, but  it depends a lot on what the board looks like. I\u2019m not crazy about Germany taking Norway. We want her taking units off the board.", "Well I'll at least communicate with Germany to the point that she thinks I'm genuinely against you. But I won't ask for any favors.", "If I do I'll let you know, and we should expect that you hear about them.", "Agreed. Yes, I\u2019m totally fine with that. We want G thinking that we\u2019re working against each other.", "And, frankly, she\u2019s going to be pissed at me after this move, so I wouldn\u2019t mind if you lied to her too at the same time to spread that out a bit.", "So plot away against me, but tell me what plan you guys work out, so we can talk about what she\u2019s most likely to do.", "France wants me to go for MAO. I'm going to say I'm on board with that. I'll say NAO is going there.", "I mean germany", "Yep. That makes sense. She wants Edi and Norway clear.", "Also, does it matter so much if Germany is mad at both of us? Isn't it basically war in the Fall?", "If I were you, I\u2019d order NAO to Norwegian. From Norwegian, you have a play to defend Norway AND Edi. Which means you could retreat to Helg if you like and you have a 50/50 to defend Norway or Edi.", "Yeah that's what I'll order", "Re G being mad: it\u2019s not the end of the world. I mean, we\u2019ll definitely be at war with her. I just don\u2019t want her trying to throw the game in spite or anything like that. Cause I am lying to her like crazy this turn. \ud83e\udd2d\ud83e\udd2b", "yeahh... it happens. i've been fortunate to not really have to lie so far.", "What are your thoughts on Mun?", "Also, just out of curiosity, did you advise Germany to build the Kiel fleet?", "I absolutely did not advise G to build the F Kie.", "We did not talk at all about that build.", "Thoughts on Mun? What do you mean?", "If G would have asked, I would have said that two armies would make me a bit uncomfortable, but I would not have insisted on a fleet, as two armies would have been more anti-Russian than anything. But she did not ask me.", "I believe you. I just was curious. And I didn't look closely enough at Mun. Ber can just support. But I thought it might be interesting to work with Russia there, even if Russia isn't the long-term ally.", "Also, who does germany think the third ally is?", "I ask because we may be interested to know whether Germany will try to sneak into Swe or not.", "Well, I\u2019m not next to Munich now, so there isn\u2019t much I can do about that. Maybe in the Fall.", "Germany and I have not discussed a third ally. She doesn\u2019t give the impression that she cares much about the east.", "I guess the question in spring is whether you move to Tyr. And would we want her moving into Russia? If she goes east and annoys her future only friend on the board, this might complicate their future relations.", "Well, that\u2019s a great idea. I am all for her moving on Russia if you can accomplish that. I\u2019m certainly willing to go to Tyrolia.", "Alright. I'll plant the seed about anti-russia stuff. If she thinks you're a friend, though, she may listen to you more than me.", "FYI, she just asked me if I am talking with you. I told her: \u201cI am wary of England right now. He just asked me what I want to do this turn. I feel like he\u2019s trying to get me to leave MAO open.\u201d", "Cool. consistent with my messaging. I'm talking about a plan to leave Bre open and get her support to Gas so I can support into Spa. I'm asking for her to promise Bre to France and then bounce in Bre instead.", "Then I'd dislodge in MAO and you'd retreat to IRI. We'll see what she thinks. I imagine she's just playing along, But I need to make specific plans to be believable", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Looks like germany is staying friendly with russia. Can we go over moves one more time so i can be sure we\u2019re on the same page?", "Here is what I have down right now:\nMAO S Brest\nWES S MAO\nLYO - TYR S\nSpa - Gas\nPie - Mar\nVen - Tyr\nNap - ION", "Cool. All expected. Right now I'm:\nNAO to NWG\nNTH hold\nWal to Pic\nChannel convoy wal to pic\nBre support Wal to Pic", "I like it. \n\nAs I think about it more, you may be better off moving North to Holland, expecting a bounce there. I think you\u2019re slightly better off keeping the German fleet in Kiel, as it\u2019s one less German unit in North Sea, but it\u2019s not a huge difference either way.", "That's good advice. I'll take it", "I\u2019m kind of excited about this turn.", "A stab is always exciting", "I\u2019m sorry mate. You\u2019ve been a terrific ally. First class all the way. But on this turn, Germany made the kind of offer I could not refuse, and so I went for it.", "I know that doesn\u2019t make it any easier, but I really mean it when I say that you\u2019ve played a strong game, and been an excellent ally.", "No worries, nicely played on your end. I think I can top Germany\u2019s offer if you\u2019re interested. Let me know!", "Hmmmm...I\u2019m intrigued. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be screaming obscenities at me right now?This response is downright classy and sportsmanlike.", "Haha yeah I suppose. But this game for me is about learning. I\u2019m relatively new to the game, and I volunteered for the study 1) to help out my friend, and 2) to prep for an in-person game I have on August 11. So if I get the right experience from this game and do well in the in-person game (i.e. win bragging rights among my friends), I\u2019ve won MY game. Here is my offer: You bring me along to second place, I vow to help you solo as Italy, and you teach me how you pulled it off. What do you say?", "Well that is a better offer than Germany\u2019s. One of the best offers I\u2019ve ever received. And I really mean it when I say that you\u2019re a joy to play with and a strong ally. I\u2019d be happy to teach you as much as I can.", "I suggest you retreat to Skagerrak to put maximum pressure on Germany.", "Well i\u2019m happy to learn if you\u2019re willing to teach. Do we have a deal then? This is obviously something you\u2019ll have to trust me with. But I haven\u2019t lied tp you yet and don\u2019t intend to. And i imagine you can tactically keep me in a position where i\u2019m not a threat. Also, on the teaching side of things I may have some questions about earlier in the game to learn how you set things up (and I would expect genuine answers!)", "And yeah, that retreat makes sense. You think norway and the home island are too defensive?", "I\u2019ll answer anything you ask honestly.", "You have more options from Skag, and she can\u2019t cover them all. You have a much higher upside from there, and it might be worth it for you to take Sweden to avoid having to disband.", "Regarding your offer: it may be hard to put you in second place, frankly. If your units are doing things that help me, then I\u2019ll try to keep your units on the board, and I definitely won\u2019t allow you to be eliminated, but it\u2019s really hard for me to ensure that you place second.", "I can settle for survival. Deal.", "Your reasoning on Skag makes sense. Going to bed now. First question on strategy is: how frequently dp you tell lies, and what are the typical circumstances?", "Hmmm, well, you know, we\u2019ll have statistics to help answer that question at the end of the game. I\u2019d say that I am mostly honest, and I place a lot of value on my credibility. I\u2019m not going to lie about my moves to someone unless I am going to get a huge advantage out of it. But I spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that I\u2019m their closest ally, so a lot of what I say is a shade on the truth.", "So, I found it hard to decide whether to use a thumbs up or thumbs down quite a lot. Most of the time, there is some truth in what I\u2019m saying, but I am trying to persuade the other player to do something for reasons I am not telling them.", "So, in general, I\u2019m not afraid to lie, but I am very afraid of getting caught lying. I try to preserve my credibility as best I can, but if I am setting up a stab, I will tell some serious whoppers.", "Also, that thing France said about my past successes: that was true. I do have a lot of experience and I have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy. I just did not want you thinking of me that way.", "I\u2019ll also note, just cause I have nobody else to talk with about this: I worked REALLY hard on this last move. Germany wanted to take Brest, but if that happened, it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island. So I had to convince Germany to support France to Brest, without telling her the real reason why. And I needed you to go to NAO so that you could not guard Liverpool. There were so many lies!\ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude31", "And that doesn\u2019t even include the East!", "To be completely honest, I directed just about everyone else\u2019s moves on that turn! Russia is the one exception, but I basically knew what he was going to do. The best advice I have for someone who wants to get better at Diplomacy: just work hard. You can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else. I have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time.", "Yeah that\u2019s one thing about online diplomacy I have mixed feelings about. It seems like there\u2019s definitely a benefit from putting a lot of time in. I feel like I\u2019ve been putting a lot of time in as it is, but there\u2019s been the temptation to put in more. For in-person everybody gets the same amount of time to chat, which can be an equalizer in some ways.", "I had considered what a stab from you might look like before it happened, and I was like \u201cis he really going to all that trouble\u201d but I suppose you were. Care to share why you chose Germany and how early you made that choice? What was the \u201coffer\u201d?", "And that\u2019s cool that i\u2019m playing with a champ!", "Hi England \u2014 so I see that you retreated to Norway. Not what I expected, but it can work. Would you still like to work with me?", "Yeah i know we didn\u2019t chat about this. It was a little last minute, and you hadn\u2019t responded in the morning so I didn\u2019t think you were around (also I thought Ska was more a suggestion). I should have given you a heads up. My thinking was 1) it\u2019s going to Sweden anyways, 2) i thought it might help warm relations with germany. Was this a bad call?", "I would still like to work with you", "Not a big deal at all.", "I suggest that you take Sweden, and I\u2019m working on getting Belgium this turn too. It\u2019ll be tricky to keep Germany from defending it, but I\u2019m going to try.", "Pic to Bel?", "And you were a bit shy about the earlier learning question. I guess it may be something sensitive to give an honest answer to at this time. One other question I have is whether there's a mistake you've seen in my play that you think I could have done differently. Like choosing to cold-shoulder France or choosing not to sneak into Sweden earlier.", "Also, France is asking about our relations after the stab. What would you like me to say?", "Something about how awful I am and how much you want revenge?\ud83e\udd2d", "Haha alright. I\u2019ll keep you \u201caBrest\u201d of how France will move that fleet (should he choose to share)", "Okay, I think we have a good move brewing!", "If you\u2019re sincerely on board, this will be fun!", "France is ordering Brest to Channel. \nGermany is ordering Burg S Bel and convoying Holland to Yorkshire....!", "So here is the move:\nNorway - Swe\nPic S Channel - Belgium\nMar - Bur to cut support\nGas to Bre to block the Paris move. \n\nI think you\u2019re going to get a build this turn even if I take Liverpool. \n\nDoes that make sense?", "Yeah I'm on board, though I will remind you that you're forgetting an important part of the bargain. So I guess NWG to Edi (which is probably safe in case she goes for the build instead) and then plan to build in London?", "What part of the bargain am I forgetting? It\u2019s unintentional. I\u2019m trying to be helpful!", "You overlooked a couple of my questions.", "I'm sure you've been busy setting up that move, so it's no big deal, just wanted to remind you", "Sorry.", "You asked a question about what Germany offered me. Do you mind if I answer that after this move? I\u2019d just like to see for sure that you\u2019re sincere in working with me after I so rudely stabbed you.", "Yeah that one's fair to skip for now I think.", "Germany is now fishing for info from me about our relationship. Does she know that we are still talking? I\u2019d like to tell her that you\u2019re mad at me and you will tell me nothing, but we must keep our stories straight.", "No, but I'd bet she'd assume it. We didn't have much to say to each other this morning. I tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasn't going to work out. And I sent a message back but haven't heard anything. So I'd imagine she'd think I'm not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Up to you how to spin it though.", "Thank you. \ud83d\udc4c", "I'm going to be hit or miss with connectivity this evening, so I'm putting moves in now. Will look just before the adjudication though. But I'm trying to get some work done. So right now I'm: Eng to Bel, Pic support Eng to Bel, Nwy to Swe, and NWG to Edi.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "I\u2019ll let you know if anything changes on my end.", "Cool, sounds good", "Hmmm, Germany is backing off the bait. I think we will have to change our plan.", "What's up?", "Not sure yet, but she is not going to leave Belgium unguarded so that won\u2019t work.", "Alright, keep me posted.", "She is pressing hard now for info from me on your moves. I am telling her that you are jovial with me, but that we have not discussed any substance.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "France is offering to move in a way that would help against you. Does it matter what I say?", "I don\u2019t think it matters. I believe he is lying to you.", "Okay. Cause you had said he\u2019d be going to the channel before. Is that still true? And any update on belgium?", "Working on it. I\u2019ll have an update in an hour.", "Ok. I\u2019ll be asleep probably, but i\u2019ll see in the morning.", "So, it sounds to me like Germany thinks you are coming for her and she will not leave Belgium unguarded. \n\nI think your best bet will be the following:\nPicardy - Brest (expect a bounce)\nChannel - London (expect that The French fleet will move to the Channel, which will mean you don\u2019t lose Brest, \nNorwegian to Edi (just in case)\nNorway to Sweden\n\nI was hoping for a better move involving taking Belgium, but I just don\u2019t think I can swing it. \n\nThoughts? What are you hearing now from France and Germany?", "Long one from Germany. Talking up your evils, talking collaboration with France. Suggested moves are NWG to Cly, holland to york, eng goes to iri or wales, belgium supports brest to channel. Pic to bre, par to pic, bur to par, mun to bur.", "Haven\u2019t responded yet. Will have a somewhat busy morning, so i\u2019ll appreciate your guidance if you think this changes anything", "Thank you. Just woke up. Thinking about this. Any ideas?", "Seems like she\u2019s going to try to take Brest for herself.", "I think you tell her \u201cyes,\u201d but then order Pic to Bre and Channel to London. That way France moves out of Brest, and you bounce Germany in Brest and keep it.", "And I\u2019d stick with NWG to Edi and Norway to Sweden.", "And by the way: Thank you very much for filling me in. Makes me feel really confident that you\u2019re with me.", "Yeah, happy to help. Just got online now. Let me take a moment to process all of this.", "Ok,first question: You're saying she's going for Bre on her own, but she's suggesting Pic to Bre. Maybe she's hoping for you to support Paris in?", "Hmmm, no, she does not expect my support. But I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s screwing over France.", "Well, do you think she's being honest with me?", "It\u2019s really hard for me to say. I know she is eager for her own builds, so my best guess is that she\u2019s being partially honest with you and that she is going to grab London or Edi if she feels confident you are not going to cover.", "Yeah, the suggestion of going to Cly is consistent with that. And that the channel moves away from london", "I think your suggestion makes sense. Covering Edi and London is safe, and Germany seems a bit unpredictable. And I keep fingers crossed that France indeed will vacate Brest", "And, since you haven't been specific on your plan for Lvp, I can only assume that you'll be moving there.", "I am planning to move to Liverpool. I\u2019m sorry that costs you a unit. But the way this is going, it may very well be the last center I take from you, and I think it\u2019s much more likely now that you take second place.", "Ok gotcha. Hmm I just realized that I really have to hope for a bounce in Edi or London. Because If I get Bre and Swe, I would get a build even with you in Lvp, but then I wouldn't have an open home supply center to build at", "Well, you\u2019re right about that. Perhaps ask Germany to bounce with you in Edi?", "Though, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be getting a build now because you\u2019re unlikely to get Belgium. But...if you think Germany is really convoying to Yorkshire, I\u2019m willing to order Marseilles to Burgundy to cut support while you support Channel to Belgium.", "If I get Bre and Swe, but you get Lvp, I'm still net up by one (it will be rebuilding the disbanded fleet that was in Bre).", "Brest is already English.", "Yeah. But I get the unit back is all I mean. I'm down to 4 now.", "I have 5 centers and 4 units now. Add Swe, hold Bre, take away Lvp, and I've got another unit to put on the board", "But only if I have a free home supply center", "Ah, you\u2019re totally right. My mistake.", "This is getting tricky.", "Haha yeah. Given your comms with France, would it make sense that she's being genuine with me?", "It\u2019s possible. But I just don\u2019t know.", "I\u2019d be really surprised if she wanted to cut out France at this point.", "Yeah, I think I have to play defensive then. I actually think aggression from her is more likely. I would be surprised if neither london or edi bounce. I'll say I agree to her proposal though.", "Okay, I think that\u2019s the right move. This is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view. It would be really great if you wind up with a build.", "Well played.", "So do I get ghosted now after you duped me?", "If your strategy is not to talk to me again, I\u2019d appreciate if you would at least let me know that, as a courtesy. Just trying to play a board game here.", "Hey, no not going to be a dick. I have agreed to not talk to you.", "Okay. I think that is a bad choice in any game of Diplomacy (and likely in any game in general), and it only helps other people. But I\u2019ll respect your choice if that is how you want to play. \n\nIf you do ever decide you want to talk, my door will always be open, no matter what. And I am willing to keep all communications secret, if that\u2019s the issue.", "Love is a game. And it\u2019s wise to stay away from your ex if the relationship was toxic", "I mean...you encouraged me to go for the solo, and then pulled the rug out from under me. I see why you did what you did. But...I\u2019m not going to solo now. Eventually the incentives will change. I never close a door because things change turn to turn. Closing our door is only good for Germany. So...it makes sense that she made you promise to close it.", "Ok there\u2019s something I want to share on the consition that this and future communications are just between the two of us. Think you can do that?", "Absolutely. The moment I try to share something with Germany, she would say it to you, so you can be sure I\u2019ll keep anything confidential.", "Welll there\u2019s a bit of an out of game thing affecting my play on some matters. And I kind of want to leave this vague since this will be in a dataset and whatever. But after the stab i thought the least i could do was make you aware.", "What is the out of game thing?", "I have a neighbor who I'd really rather not brutally backstab, and it's not you (clearly). Does that make sense?", "Sure.", "So what will you do if you won't solo?", "Well, the solo is clearly off the table. Without your help I never would have made that play in the east. I am outnumbered there and I will slowly melt away.", "So, I will lose some centers and try to find someone who wants to work with me.", "Well, it sounds like you mean the solo right now. You don\u2019t think an eventual solo is off the table for you, right?", "Eh, anything can happen, but I\u2019m not really motivated to do that at this point. I\u2019d accept a draw right now if everyone was on board.", "You know, I might be in the same boat there. This game has invaded my life enough as it is. I think I prefer in-person. It's a long day, but when it's done it's done. Although you don't really get the fresh start you do with online (things like \"i remember what you did to me last time\" come up when playing with friends)", "My five-way draw vote is up. If you can rally the troops, we can get to the interesting stats!", "I mean isn\u2019t this getting called off in 1910 anyways? That\u2019s when the study ends. And how does the draw vote work? Do people see what you voted if it doesn\u2019t go through?", "Do your other moves not go through if you propose a draw?", "I\u2019m not sure how the draw vote works on Backstabbr. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s visible. But I believe you just have to go down to the scroll bar at the bottom that says \u201cSolo Victory\u201d and scroll down to \u201cfive-way draw.\u201d", "Well, I\u2019ll see what I can do then. The alternative is that we just duke it out for another couple of years until admin calls it.", "Austria sounds game for a draw.", "Haha no surprise there. Just reached out to russia. Germany is sworn to fight against you till the end (though a stab against me is inevitable too). But maybe we can convince if all others are on board", "Russia on board. Germany is the last holdout. Doesn't believe we'll draw, or maybe doesn't want to. I'd really also like to get people to mark \"Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders\" as well, just to get it over with.", "I don\u2019t really know what Germany\u2019s problem is. I helped her a ton in this game. It\u2019s weird to me that she has such a vendetta.", "I guess it makes sense for her from a strategic standpoint to make me out to be a boogie man to get everyone headed this way.", "Well I did expose some of your double-dealing to her, which might have helped. But yeah, agreed that it's in her interest to get everyone against you, and then stab me when convenient.", "Sent to Germany, England, Austria, Russia: So, England, Germany, Russia, y\u2019all played a great turn last turn. You got me to stab my long-time ally and you ended our pretty excellent 7-year run as an alliance. Russia told me he was with me if I stab Austria. England told me he wanted me to solo so long as I would \u201cteach him\u201d and help his along to second place. Then y\u2019all pulled the rug out from under me. It was clever and effective. (End Part 1)", "(Part 2)\nAt this stage, my excitement about the game has diminished quite a bit. And of course I\u2019m happy to play on and take my lumps for falling for \u201cHey, I really want you to solo, just help me place second,\u201d but if you guys just want to call it a five-way draw among us and grab a beer together, while reviewing the statistics, that\u2019s really my preference. \n\nI am outnumbered and I obviously can\u2019t solo. And I\u2019m sure some of you in the north are eager to send everyone else flying my way, but I expect Russia and England to be careful, and so I\u2019m not sure there is much room to move forward without simply tipping the board to Germany\u2019s favor. \n\nI propose that we draw and hug it out.\ud83e\udd17", "Reply all to Italy's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the \"Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders\" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.", "Zzzzzzzzzzz", "Any idea who didn\u2019t want to draw?", "I have a guess, but no idea. I have heard from nobody.", "Huh. I was thinking it\u2019s possible the game was set up in some way to not respect the draw order? I don\u2019t know that much about the site and how the admin chose to configure the game", "Oh, that could be. Maybe it has to run to 1910?", "It\u2019s not you, is it?", "I feel like it's gotta be you holding out on the draw. Well, good luck getting to 18 by the end of next year.", "Hey. Good game. I think folks are pretty much done. I know i\u2019m ready to move on. The draw proposal combined with the impending end of the game was effective in making us slack on our moves a bit (e.g., russia skipped a build this year). I don\u2019t know that i can say whether you have a clear path to a solo if we were to continue. I know germany and I could at least get MAO next year, which would put pressure on Por and Spa. I think we\u2019d all appreciate a draw though. Otherwise it will be \u201citaly kind of won but kind of didn\u2019t because the game got cut short\u201d.

{"messages": ["Hello! Thoughts on how you like to play as Italy?", "Hi France!\n\nWell, I generally don\u2019t like to play as Italy at all, frankly. But when I do, I go east.

It takes forever to get there, and there are rarely centers there for me when I arrive. I hope you feel the same way about moving towards me. \n\nI\u2019d like to keep our border clear and I\u2019d like to act as \u201ctrio wires\u201d for each other. Basically, if either Germany or England want to attack you, I expect they\u2019ll mention something to me, and if you\u2019ll look out for me diplomatically, I\u2019ll give you a head\u2019s up if ever you need to worry. \n\nHow do you like to play France?", "I'm happy to hear that! I have the same opinion when it comes down to our relationship. I prefer to play France decisevely in the West when an opportunity presents itself. Since that opportunity might not present itself for a long time, I often times end up playing a bit more reactively.\n\nI'd love to be trio wires. I've heard from everyone in the east, but not much substance, which probably means a bunch of passive openings.  If there's little fighting between the Eastern powers it might make it tougher for us, so hopefully things will shake up a bit in that department. If you are also finding that there isn't a whole lot of commitment going on there, and you have some interest in an unorthodox play, then maybe there is some potential for us to work together directly.", "Yeah, everyone is cagey and conservative, at least in words. If you have thoughts on something unorthodox, I love that kind of plan, so I\u2019d love to hear it.", "Ha \u2014 I meant \u201ctrip wire\u201d above. That should make more sense.", "But I appreciate that you also agreed to be \u201ctrio wires.\u201d \ud83e\udd23", "That is funny, I was thinking that trio referred to the 3 Western/Eastern countries \ud83d\ude02 . In terms of unorthodox plans, I was thinking that if you moved to Tyrolia and Venice it would appear to be an attack on Austria, but that we could then perform a joint attack on Munich instead. I'm not sure if you actually want Munich or to get embroiled in Germany, but I thought I'd throw it out there.", "Heads up: England is sniffing around. Wants to know if I\u2019d be in to move to Piedmont if he takes the Channel.", "Thanks for the heads up!", "Nothing from Germany suggesting he\u2019s in on it. I think that guy is going to be conservative.", "That is really good to know- I wish I had more information on the East to share, but unfortunately I haven't gotten anything back yet.", "Hoping we can help each other out this way all game.", "I hope so too!", "Just from the way the pieces moved, it's looking pretty good for you! What's your read on things?", "Oh...I don\u2019t know. Looks like I may be destined to become one of those forever-stuck-on-four Italys that flounders about for a while and then dies. \ud83d\ude14\n\nGermany seems very passive. You seem aggressive, and pointed away from me, which warms my heart. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on the board?", "True. Us staying out of each-others way is what allowed me to be a bit more aggressive, so thank you for that \ud83d\ude42. It looks like Russia and Turkey are squabbling, which is probably great for Austria who started off very strong. I agree that Germany is a bit passive, and now does not have the option to prevent Russia from taking sweden. It's tough to read England. You may have some opportunities if everyone is on board with the Lepanto, and could possibly convince Austria to give you a center", "I am only using my downward thumb for Germany so far. He keeps telling me transparent lies about you. Lol. \n\nLet\u2019s please never fight. The bad guys are going to try to make us fight. Let\u2019s just not.", "Thanks for the heads up. I agree completely. As a side note, do you have a read on England by any chance? I want to work with him at this point, but he seems to be on the fence about it.", "I haven\u2019t really heard much from him. I think I disappointed him when I said \u201cno thanks\u201d on Piedmont. Let me reach out to him now and see if I can get a read.", "I have been presuming that I don\u2019t need to say \u201cA fleet in Marseilles would make my skin crawl,\u201d but maybe I should say it?", "In this case, my hand was forced and I had to build armies. I don't anticipate building a fleet in Marseilles (in fact, that turn right there may have been my last build phase ever) but if that changes then I will certainly give you heads up!", "Have you and Austria thought about ways to slow down England/Germany in case they decide to alliance and pick  up Scandinavia and French dots? I would be fully supportive of an attack on Munich.", "I think we have a lot to do in the east before we make that kind of move. Any chance you can get England on your side?", "True. The east is looking very nice for you and Austria :). I'm working on it but it is tough, and I am of course worried about the fleet London build and Germany building 2 armies. If England is no longer asking you to attack me then that would be a good sign.", "Well, I\u2019m just a four-center Italy. Let\u2019s not get too excited yet. \n\nI haven\u2019t heard a thing from England in quite a while. No idea what he\u2019s thinking.", "Hey- just thought I'd contact you and offer you some centers \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02", "I wanted to tell you sooner, but the bot was down.", "You just got two thumbs down!", "Good luck this turn.", "Should we talk builds? I\u2019d like to avoid F Mar.", "Sure. I won't build a fleet in Mar.", "I'm sure you have plans in the near term already set. Have you put any thought into how you would like the mid game to look like?", "Oh...I\u2019m planning on killing both Austria and Turkey if I can. Though, not sure yet how I\u2019m going to pull it off. Any ideas?", "Hmm. I imagine Turkey falls first. It was smart of you to take Greece so that Austria is the one at the front of the attack. Once Austria has committed deep into Turkey you should have plenty of opportunities. I think it would be a matter of just waiting for the right time. Russia may be interested in working with you since his interests and Austria's interests are probably not as aligned in the long term.", "The bot is back up \ud83d\ude03", "Sorry for the delay. Just looking at the game again now.", "Hi friend, are you still there?", "Basically, I am getting a bit of an ultimatum from my friends in the east, and I would like to arrange for a feint in your direction this turn, to set up an attack on Austria, but I want to share it with you first.", "I believe I am getting a build this turn (crossing my fingers), and I plan to build A Ven to set up an invasion of Austria.", "But that only works if he doesn\u2019t see it coming. So my plan is to use Tyrolia to support hold Munich this turn (it\u2019s the only way to keep that army in Tyr) and to move my fleets to TYS and TUN. Then I build A Ven, and I attack Trieste while Austria heads towards Russia and I circle my fleets back around Austria.", "The one fly in the ointment is that it requires some trust from my light blue friend in the west. I can only hope that we\u2019ve built up enough rapport that you understand where I\u2019m coming from here, and you let me engage in this bit of sleight of hand.", "Just saw the moves, and then read your messages. OK- I trust you, but don't fuck me on this. I do have a back up plan, but I'd like to not go there \ud83d\ude01.", "I like this response.", "You\u2019re going to like my next move set, and you\u2019re not going to need your backup plan.", "I think the key here is to get Germany back on your side. England is not wavering. He sent me a case of Champaign for my last move.", "Thanks- yes, England has ceased all communications with me by now", "Such a charmer.", "Nothing to say after that last turn?", "Hey. Sorry. I try to be more communicative. Just a very long day for me yesterday. \n\nYou seem to have sniffed out my attack quite well, and now I\u2019m facing Austria getting 2 builds, while I likely get none. So...bad turn for me, and it may cost me the game. \n\nI stabbed you. There\u2019s no getting around that. Perhaps it is some solace to you that I may have completely yanked my own game in doing so?", "It is what it is, a stab on Austria has sailed past for the time being, but with any of these grand alliances there will be another opportunity later (provided that Austria doesn't stab you first). I'm going to do what I believe will maximize my chances of survival, and if that means working with you then I won't hold that grudge. It depends how creative you are willing to get. Given English communications with me, I can't imagine that they are easy to work with.", "I'd like to float the option of your fleets sailing past mine and into the Mid Atlantic. This obviously runs great risks for myself, but I believe I have a higher chance of survival in the long run this way. I also believe it may be in your best interests as well. You want to get past the stalemate lines, and this is the best way to do it.", "Builds are a problem for you. But they will be anyway as you have to make a coin flip guess on Spain/Marseilles. On the other hand, Austria has two guaranteed builds and more coming. Given the nature of that alliance, I'm sure Austria may be willing to share those builds with you.", "I'm in a tough spot, but I also believe in the long run. That's why I want to be clear that I'm not desperate- I won't be selling myself to whoever will support me on any given turn. From my perspective, I just need one unit to be in a draw. So, if there's a slim chance for me to be a one unit survivor in a monster Italy/Austria draw, I'll help you and Austria as much as I can.", "Any thoughts for me? How would you go about making a French-Italy alliance work?", "Hey, so I really appreciate this string of messages.", "Just really strong diplomacy. Flexible, fun, mutual advantage seeking. My kind of player.", "I will respond to honesty with honesty: I really need a build this turn. I am concerned about two Austrian builds setting me up to get stabbed. For that reason, I am very much inclined to take my 50/50 shot at a French center this turn.", "On the other hand, I quite like the idea of sending my fleets passed you.", "So...I really like your message, and I\u2019m trying to think how it could all work.", "But, I don\u2019t know if I can give up my 50/50 shot at a build. I NEED a build or I likely get stabbed, I\u2019m afraid.", "Also, England is very much set up to get stabbed by a surprise I/F here. I mean, that would be super fun.", "I will tell you this: England and Germany are both very interested in your demise, and that makes you a more attractive ally for me, as I don\u2019t want to see E/F grow strong and grow affectionate after breaking bread in Paris.", "So I guess what I\u2019m saying is: allow me a build this turn, and I\u2019d be quite happy to push to be in Irish Sea next year.", "You might find yourself in a bit of a janissary position, but you won\u2019t have to fear that I\u2019ll just stab you for all your centers because I would be far to early to make a solo run, and I\u2019d just invite backlash from the rest of the board. I\u2019m not a dimwit who strikes out on poorly considered solo runs too early.", "(I do it at exactly the right time \ud83e\udd2d)", "Thoughts?", "Also, it would do you some good to prevent Germany from taking Burgundy this year. My head is spinning a bit from a really fun 1905 in which I support you into Munich and move to North Atlantic on the same turn.", "I'm really glad that you are entertaining a plan like this. You call it strong diplomacy, but it only works because you are constantly looking for the best opportunities and going after them. I can get you a build. I thought about ways to do it subtly, but I wonder if it might just be better to go in for it. I can send a fleet from MAO to NAO unopposed. If you get a fleet into MAO, this will set up an unstoppable convoy directly into Clyde. The best way to do this would probably be to have you convoy Piedmont to Spain using the Gulf of Lyons, and use West Med to take MAO, thus allowing a future Spain to Clyde convoy.", "I am going to support an attack into Mar or Spa (I will not move to both), but if you move to NAO and keep Germany out of Burgundy, I will absolutely come out guns blazing against England next year, and maybe Germany too.", "Done. This gets a bit weird since the move is only really effective if you follow me into MAO, and if you tell me that then in theory I know how to defend. So instead of you telling me your moves, I'll just tell you mine. I believe that I can move to NAO, prevent Germany from taking Burundy, and hit Marseilles with a force of two all at once. This move set will leave Spain and MAO unguarded and you will be able to walk in to both. If you choose to do that, I believe we can guarantee Liverpool next year.", "My best guess is that Germany will try to take Belgium this turn, and if she does ideally that build will be a fleet. My gut feeling is that while Germany may not like me very much, she seems to trust you. If you work your diplomatic magic I think she would be happy to build a fleet and attack England with her fleets.", "Hmmmm, I need to stop giving you thumbs ups. You\u2019re ruining my truth detector score.", "Kind of a pointless lie if you ask me, but I won\u2019t hold it against you. You\u2019re in a tough spot.", "Well maybe not, since it was a truth when I sent it out. But it seemed like you were not interested in going to the mid Atlantic ocean based on your messages, and I felt like it would be pointless to go to NAO if you were not headed to MAO. The other part of the equation was the fact that I offered you Spain for free- and you passed that up in favor of a guess. Maybe you didn't trust me, but it got me thinking about why you would pass on a deal like that.", "Also, given the moves you attacked both Spain and Marseilles, moved out of Tyrolia, and Germany did not attack Burgundy. So there's also that \ud83d\ude06", "I get that there was a better way to handle this. And I should have let you know that the move to NAO was off. I really am sorry about that. But you have to know that I was 100% serious about attacking England with you. I make crazy unnexpected plays like that all the time in high stakes Diplomacy games, so for a game that's more of a beta test than game, it's natural. And we can still do it too. I'd love to hear your suggestions on how to make it stick, and it's something Germany is certainly interested in as well.", "I\u2019m giving you a bunch of these \ud83d\udc4e for those comments.", "You made a deal with me, and did something else instead. That doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t consider another deal, but I don\u2019t want you to think that is lost on me.", "Hey look- I know your upset. I hope you can see things from my point of view though. I was in the heat of the moment and I really really really wanted this to work. It would be so fun, and I could finally get back at England for being a total piece of crap. And then I sobered up and read between the lines, and realized how terrible your deal would be for me as it turns out you weren't actually offering me anything. I wanted to work with you so badly I had convinced myself to make awful moves. So if you want to downvote all my messages, you can kiss your truth telling ratio good bye. Keep it up and it will be lower than mine \ud83d\ude18.", "Well, let me know if you want to talk about anything else.", "And by the way, I think the deal I offered was pretty good for you \u2014 much better than doing nothing. It did not give you anything in the short-term, but that was because I had a short-term need and no reason to make a sacrifice to you to get a deal done. I proposed a deal that was good for me because I intended to follow through.", "You may get better proposals from others, but not better proposals that they intend to actually follow through on.", "Seems like you\u2019ve decided to write me off as someone who can be useful to you, and so you\u2019re going to spread lies to others about me instead.", "That stuff gets back to me.", "You don\u2019t owe me anything. And I attacked you, so I won\u2019t begrudge you your vengeance. But that said, I was pretty darn sincere when I said I thought there was a way forward for us.", "All I wanted from you was for us to kill England first. Get you past the stalemate lines and then you can circle back for French dots. I even offered you Spain for free. If you really were interested in something like this, you would not only have your build, but be in Clyde.\n\nThat's the thing though- you don't want to be there. You want ME to be there so that you can keep pretending to be on England's side. And you want your units to be in France.\n\nI don't doubt you were sincere. But launching an ineffective attack on England while Italy eats me from behind in the hopes that eventually Italy soloes even though he's going to get stopped at the stalemate lines because Italy just has to be friends with England? Not a fan. If there's a way forward it's with you sending a fleet to MAO and putting your fleets past the lines. Or it's with you withdrawing and finally stabbing Austria like you said you would a few years ago.\n\nAll you've done so far is build an EG alliance and waste both of our time in the med. With all your grand talk, I just thought you had a better plan than this.", "At the very least you should be trying to get England and Germany to fight. At this rate they will continue to get French dots while you still are stuck at 0. You have so many units on the Western front that it honestly makes no sense for you to share spoils with EG.", "I appreciate the advice. If I feel like you sincerely want to work with me, I\u2019ll be much more inclined to encourage England and Germany to fight. Honestly, I\u2019m quite sure that you and I, working together, could accomplish that very quickly. But lately I\u2019m learning that you\u2019re mostly trying to get people to distrust me.", "So, I think we\u2019re going to have some trouble bridging this gap.", "If you\u2019d like to give your centers to England and Germany a kind of payback to me, that\u2019s certainly within your power. It\u2019s not how I\u2019d like this game to go, but there may be satisfaction in that for you,", "Ok, I get that you are concerned by me \"spreading rumors,\" but you and I haven't exactly been working together, so I feel like trying to get England to stop attacking me is a fair message to send. Maybe you don't know this, but I've sent England a message every season for the past 9 or 10 seasons and they have ignored each message. In fact, I'm so glad you told me about this since it proves that England is reading my messages and just not responding to them.", "You seem to have interpreted this as some kind of vengeance against you. That's not the case. I'm literally just trying to survive here.", "And while I can't confirm it, I heavily suspect you have your own little group with England and Germany where you all slander me plenty \ud83d\ude09 .", "Well, you have choices about who to work with. Let me know if you ever get serious about working with me.", "Anyway, I\u2019m just going to keep flipping a coin over Marseilles or Spain. One day I\u2019ll guess it right.", "I think the best way to work together at this point is an Italian withdrawal. The good thing is that this is pretty easy. If you move to Ionian you can convoy Piedmont to Greece/Albania.", "The reason why is that England has already brought their fleets around and even if we could get you into the MAO they've already set up a line that we would struggle immensely to cross.", "At some point English Channel will plug up Irish Sea and NWG will go to NAO. What I'm saying is that it's too late, the opportunity is gone.", "Maybe if Germany turns on England. But is that even possible at this point? Just looking at the board and the moves, I think they are along for the full ride.", "Obviously you can potentially gain if you keep attacking me. But I think that's Gambler's fallacy. Actually, you won't \"one day guess it right\". Theoretically, it's possible for me to ALWAYS be right.", "That\u2019s not the gambler\u2019s fallacy. And it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that if I keep flipping a coin, one of these days it will turn up heads.", "If you\u2019d like to work with me, all you need to do is leave either Spain or Marseilles open, and tell me which one. I\u2019ll take one build, and the two of us will round the corner.", "And you won't take any of my other centers until we wipe out England?At the moment I'm defending both.", "It's not unreasonable at all. Just France happens to be tough to kill, and compounded onto that I'm a very lucky person \ud83d\ude09.", "If you are using your units to move towards England, and I feel I can trust you, I\u2019m not going to take your other centers. That would be foolish of me to do.", "Hmm. Any way we can do this without having me go down a unit? If you move to MAO I'm pretty sure you'll get in.", "That just isn\u2019t a good deal for me. Everything on the board says I should work with England against you (and so I plan to give him MAO). If I think I have a loyal France who wants to do something fun, I\u2019m willing to shake things up. But without that, I\u2019m not just going to call off my attack.", "Nice moves. You made the right call.", "Well thank you. You won 3 coin flips in a row, so the congratulations is for you. I was bound to get lucky eventually.", "I do appreciate some of the misdirection stuff that you\u2019ve done. I\u2019ll mention it after the game, but good stuff.", "I think your play had to be to try to get Austria to stab me on one of the last few turns, but it didn\u2019t quite work out.", "Thanks. You saw right through it, so it didn't actually end up helping \ud83d\ude02. Yeah, I was hoping to stall this out for longer, but at this point I've got to choose a side and throw to them. Me moving to NAO was an olive branch short of giving you a free dot.", "Yeah, if I were you, I would have approached it the same way. You did hold out longer than most would, getting triple teamed, but you needed someone elsewhere on the board to see that it was bad for them for you to fall.", "If I get a say in how my dots are distributed, I'd like them to go to you and Germany. I'm not sure how good your relationship with Germany is, but put in a good word for you with them. Whatever the case, you've set this game up brilliantly to the point where I would not be surprised to see you solo.", "You are cordially welcomed to distribute dots to me at any time and for any reason.", "And I like Germany too.", "If you are interested in retreating to Irish, I would take support to the Channel in Fall if you\u2019ll offer it. Could be interesting.", "Sure actually. Changed my retreat to the Irish.", "Cool!", "If you are interested, we can move Marseilles up into Burgundy as well.", "Well, that would be amazing for me. So, this is exactly the sort of creative arrangement I was talking about earlier. \n\nMAO - Channel\nWES - MAO\nMar - Bur\nPie - Mar\nLYO S Pie - Mar", "Is Germany going to keep Paris?", "Yeah I think Germany probably will given the situation. Very awesome orders, I am all for it.", "I kind of love these orders.", "They are not what anyone will expect. And I can play them off as both pro-German and pro-English.", "Are we still okay with the Channel plan? Germany has been asking me about it, and it seems like she doesn\u2019t like the plan. I\u2019m also nervous about her tipping off England. Do we really need to run everything by her?", "I am. I won't share any other info with Germany- I figured she'd want to know about the plan before it happened but I think it just made her more worried.", "Cool. Thank you.", "Here are my orders this turn. If you\u2019d like to grant me Spain, I\u2019ll raise Hell with that build, but I\u2019m okay with you hanging onto it right now if you support me to Channel. \n\nMAO - Channel\nLYO - Spa\nWES S LYO - Spa\nMar - Bur\nPie - Mar", "Sounds good. I'm not much use to you without supply centers, so for now I plan to support Spain to hold. Moving West Med to MAO may be a good idea since then you could get more fleets in action.", "Hmmm, both England and Germany are sniffing around trying to get my moves. What should I tell them?", "Eh, sorry. I got a good offer from the bad guys.", "My plan has changed.", "Haha, it was too late to change my orders, but it hardly would have mattered. It is not yet clear what you get out of that deal, but I guess it will be apparent to me next year. Surprised if you were going to stab me that you didn't go for Portugal with MAO.", "Yeah, I just figured that you might keep your last unit alive as a janissary if I kept Portugal blue.", "You played well this game, and frankly, one of the reasons I attacked you was that you seemed like you\u2019d outplay me eventually if you were given room to breath.", "I respect and appreciate if you want to hold out in Portugal or Gascony. But if you\u2019d like to keep playing, one option would be to keep Irish on the board, and then support me to NAO in Spring. Then we take a shot at Liverpool. I desperately need fleets on that side of MAO, so if you keep helping me, I have every reason in the world to keep Portugal blue.", "I was thinking about keeping Irish for sure. I don't have home centers so I have all the incentive in the world to help you and Germany as much as I can. That makes things completely safe for you and Germany as I have no benefit from gaining another dot. Another option is to keep Picardy with the goal of popping Brest and taking the Channel. Thanks for the kind words, though I think you shouldn't have worried about me too much. Somewhere along the line I kind of majorly pissed off England, and I think Germany probably works with them against me due to having only 1 fleet at the time. So I would have been fighting a 2V1 anyway if you had done your own thing in the East.", "The ultimate fun would a convoy of Spain to Liverpool in the Spring!", "So, thoughts on where to go from here?", "Perhaps you\u2019d like support to Brest?", "I\u2019m going to go ahead and plug in that support. Though, possible that England might cut it.", "Already ordered! Not sure if you and Germany are coordinating, but when I spoke with her she said she wanted me to move to Brest to pop the England fleet as well.", "Yes. We talked it through. \ud83d\ude0a", "Hello brother \u2014 How are things going in Brest?", "Not bad. Haven't had anyone tell me what I'm supposed to do there so I guess I'm just holding", "Well that\u2019s an interesting thing to say. I\u2019ve heard lots of people telling me what you\u2019re supposed to do, but they have more to gain by lying I suppose.", "What am I supposed to do? Haha", "You are instructed to move to Channel, as far as I understand.", "Good game France. \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7", "Thanks!

{"messages": ["Guten Tag! Wanted to touch base about your plans for this year.", "your destruction, mostly. but plans can change", "Nobody makes it far without friends in this game. I suppose you're hoping to be friends with France then?", "I don't consider it wise to put stock in any friendship until it's proven. However, I tend to trust people more if they are willing to give me some information before asking it from me", "Well, that makes two of us then. You're welcome to ask a specific question if you have one though.", "Alright then. What are your plans for the North Sea these days?", "I'll be moving there this spring. Just doing a pretty standard northern opening. You taking the fleet to Holland or Denmark (or somewhere else)?", "My fleet is Holland-bound. Pleasure doing business \ud83d\ude03", "Alright, thanks for letting me know. I'd also like to talk about me going to Belgium. I imagine this is something a bit less amenable to you, but maybe something we could bargain over?", "Well, now the Belgium discussion changes a bit. France has this secured unless we collaborate in opposition. Also, I can prevent your move to Denmark.", "I'd be amenable to that. To be clear, Would you want me to move my fleet to Belgium while your North Sea fleet supports?", "So I could do this, but to secure the move you would also have to cut the support from Bur that France will likely give to move Pic to Bel. You can just attack Bur from Mun to do this. Also, providing this support is a bit of a favor and might put me at odds with France. Would you be willing to offer Denmark to sweeten the deal for me?", "how can you take Denmark while also supporting me from the north sea?", "Oh I'm talking about next year. Should have clarified. But this would require you keeping out this year.", "I'm sorry, but why? Why couldn't I hold it for this Winter and then dip in the Spring to let you in?", "I'd sooner keep Denmark and let you be the one to occupy Belgium, if that's preferable (i.e. support your North sea fleet moving there)", "The reason is because I'd need your support into denmark to be sure russia couldn't bump me out. And it's putting a lot of trust in you to expect you'll just clear the way for me.", "Well so what do you think of my counter offer, then?", "I certainly appreciate it. The only issue is that it still doesn't guarantee Belgium for me. France may support Bur from Pic instead, and then it would be a bounce.", "I have it on, admittedly, Italian authority that France is trying to make a play for Munich from Burgundy. But even if that weren't the case, vacating burgundy would leave Marseilles vulnerable to me. So I think the only option for France that wouldn't be Pyrrhic is to move from Pic", "That's fair. At the least I'd like to keep France out of Belgium, even if I don't end up with it.", "Also I had to look up Pyrrhic haha", "haha -- so, do we have a deal, then? I'll attack Burgundy while supporting your move to belgium, and you'll let me take Denmark this turn?", "Yes, we have a deal.", "Your holland fleet supports Nth to Bel and I stay out of Denmark this turn.", "you have a healthy sense of distrust and I respect that. But I appreciate you not trying to keep me out of Denmark nonetheless.", "Also, do you have thoughts on how we might collaborate next year? What are your goals, and what are your concerns?", "You\u2019re giving me too much credit. I forgot to click submit on my order for the north sea or something. Was surprised myself to see a hold there. So why did you back out of the deal then?", "Preferred to see France there.", "I can understand why you might have made that move, but I think it\u2019s actually bad for both of us. Even if you and France team up to knock me out, france will get the better part of that deal and will then work with Russia to take you down.", "If I work with France, we\u2019ll bring Russia in on it (who needs some help after what happened with Turkey). This looks good for all three of us, and very bad for you.", "The last option is for us to work together against France. On the one hand, this is a good move because France is a strong player in a strong position. On the other hand, how am I supposed to trust you at all to cooperate?", "Real talk: I was given bad information that you and France were working together last round, which does not seem to be the case, but that's why I didn't follow through on our deal. I am well positioned now to take Belgium, and I can see now that, as you say, it would be much easier on me to ally with you rather than try to take you down even with France's help. But I can understand if you don't want to trust me.", "I was working with France, and I still have a positive relationship with france. We agreed to stay out of the english channel, and france had agreed to support me into belgium. But this was about hedging my bets, not working against you. And you see how that played out haha.", "France would love for me to be an ally in taking you out of the game over the next couple of years. They\u2019ve been talking about convincing russia to help with the takedown.", "A joint stab against france would require a high level of collaboration on our end. Something like an agreement to essentially act as one country up until a certain year. Sharing all planned moves, following up on them etc. So this would be my condition for working together.", "I would be willing to do that, but as I see it, you have no reason to choose France as an ally over me at this point. So, why me?", "*choose me as an ally over france", "So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.", "So basically France is too smart to be left alive and the world ought to belong to us idiots \ud83d\ude02", "What about Russia?", "Haha yeah that was kind of my thinking. Russia is a little tied up in the south, and so I don't expect aggression in the north. However, france would respond to a stab by begging for Russian (and potentially austrian and italian) assistance. So the choice next year is between containing russia or being aggressive (which would mean going for sweden or St. P). I think the builds we see this winter will make it more clear what's possible.", "Speaking of, what are your planned builds? I'm building a fleet in London.", "Armies in Kiel and Munich", "What are your plans for your north sea and London fleets?\n\nI'm trying to decide now how best to handle Belgium and that is going to depend on whether France is concerned with defending Brest or if instead they expect help from you in disrupting anything I try to do from Holland. \n\n...I can offer you support in moving into Sweden in exchange for supporting my Burgundy troops into Belgium? Is that worth more than whatever France might be offering you right now?", "Any thoughts on my offer?\nI have another proposal if you\u2019re interested", "England. You're killin me here.", "Hey sorry. Busy evening for me. Let me think a second and respond to all this..", "Ok so for one thing France isn't exactly offering me anything, so there's no real comparison of your offer vs theirs.", "My once concern about the full-on france stab would be that the job couldn't be done quickly enough. We could force Bel this year, but we unfortunately wouldn't be able to put France down a unit because Spa is a guarantee for France. This may even allow for a rebuild in Bre if the Belgian army gets dislodged.", "That's where my new plan comes in!", "Ok what's the sitch", "You move fleets to Eng, Ska, and Nth this turn. Italy moves to Pie. I move Hol-Bel, Kie-Ruh, Bur-Gas, Mun-Bur. Now, France might foresee me attempting to take Gas, but more likely they want to dislodge me from Bur. This puts them in a position where they will have to lose one of Paris, Belgium, Marseilles, or Brest, and will not be able to vacate the others for building season.", "France could stop by bumping Par and Mar in Gas right? And you're suggesting my moves a setup of going against russia?", "Also, have you talked to Italy about this?", "Damn--I didn't think of the bumping. (sorry, this is just my first game and I'm still learning). And yeah I thought you'd want to grab Sweden because why not? \n\nI haven't discussed the full plan, but they seemed amenable to moving to pie", "Okay how about this:", "Keep your fleets in NWG and NTH, but move to ENG. Have NTH support HOL-BEL. \nI'll attack BUR-PIC, move KIE-RUH, MUN-BUR. If France does a Gascon Bounce, They'll have to lose either Brest or Paris or Marseilles. If they try to dislodge me instead, I'll retreat to Gascony. \nYou still get my support to march on Sweden in Fall if desired.", "Keep in mind that Munich is vulnerable. Italy and Austria may have a deal in the works for that. But this is the sort of plan that I had thought through originally.", "This would be a break of my DMZ with France in the channel. Which is why the success of a stab like this is especially important.", "well ya could have saved me some brain cells by sharing it in the first place! \ud83d\ude1b  \nAnd Italy and Austria, unless they're lying, think of me as an ally. That said, my plan doesn't actually involve vacating Munich", "Oh fair, because you're not actually moving into Pic, you're just cutting the support. I had you moving from Bur to Bel. Dislodging the French army from Bel could result in a disband. And if we don't get an additional supply center could mean a rebuild in Brest, which would be bad for me (adding Spain is probably a given). Have you considered the potential support of Mar from Spa s.c. ?", "Yeah if my calculations are correct the French home supply centers hold. First move is to bounce in Gas to keep you out, then move spain to s.c. and lose bel. Next move is to support hold in mar from spain s.c. and then bounce paris to brest to keep me out. Bre, Par, and Mar all hold in the fall.", "OK, Marseilles might be a no-go this round then. \n\nIf you don't want a rebuild in Brest, we'll simply attack Picardy and force a retreat to Brest by an army. Not so bad for your fleet, right? I'll move into Paris from BUR", "wait I mean A retreat to burgundy by that army. Then the Parisian Army will be in brest, so no rebuild will occur", "Well, it kind of becomes rock paper scissors there. If I try to go into Brest it's a bounce and it remains open. If I don't, and France takes the risk of not going (probably won't happen) then it would stay open too.", "Sounds like you'd like the belgian army to disband though. I understand, as it could help somebody out to take munich from Ruh.", "whoa dude I just want a supply center don't go talking about people invading the fatherland\n\nSo are you saying no deal, then?", "No, I'm just echoing your probable reasoning for wanting the disband of the belgian army rather than its retreat to Ruh.", "I don't see what that has to do with you, though? Like what difference does it make to you whether that army disbands or retreats to Ruh?", "The disband allows for a rebuild, if there's an open home supply center and France still has 5 total. So this could mean building a fleet in Brest.", "ohhh I see. So what you're saying is you'd accept the deal if I didn't arrange for the disband and allowed a retreat to Ruh?", "Let me sleep on it. I may be fine regardless. I'll confirm moves in the morning. But for this plan, Spring looks like your support into Sweden and my support into Belgium. I'll be very curious to see moves from Russia-Italy-Austria. If they all converge in on you, this could be trouble. I doubt that level of collaboration is going to happen though.", "hang on would you be willing to postpone your sweden march until Fall? I'm not so keen on forcing Russia into the baltic", "You'd still hold sweden by winter", "Yeah that would be fair. Just need to run it by russia that norway is a hold in the spring so that doesn\u2019t raise any eyebrows", "Well, or you could march into Finland just to spice things up", "Well England you've taught me an important lesson", "This isn\u2019t a full stab. I\u2019m sorry for the deception though. I hadn\u2019t heard whether Italy was anti-French. Now I have. I\u2019m taking Denmark this year with Russian support. I\u2019m sorry for that too. Kiel can\u2019t save it. I\u2019d suggest you bounce kiel and munich in Ruh and then attack holland from belgium to cut support . This will hold the line (unless france decides to let you into belgium, which would be unlikely).", "I know you don\u2019t want to take advice from me, but you\u2019re kind of in survival mode now. We can talk about belgium for you next year to get you back on your feet.", "England, I have 0.0 reason to trust your advice regarding France. You're so clearly working with them!", "I think the tactical suggestion stands on its own though. You can work through the rules to verify it makes sense (and should, in case i\u2019m making a mistake). Also I don\u2019t know france\u2019s moves this season. And you should ping italy to talk about me.", "Nice! I guess you knew what you were doing.", "well not really--I just assumed that attacking a convoying fleet would disrupt the convoy and that was apparently wrong", "Yeah you have to dislodge. But you held ruhr! And my way wouldn\u2019t have worked actually. That\u2019s a stalemate line if you do the same moves except the fleet goes to belgium (i think). Can only be broken if i support it. Of course france could choose to let you in to ruhr as well", "Hi, not sure what you heard from italy. Looking forward to the three of us working against france though. Let me know where you\u2019re at with this. I\u2019d help you into belgium this year.", "Okay, I\u2019m down to cooperate.", "Ok. All i need from you in the spring is to not attack Nth. Then i\u2019ll support myself into the channel. Then i support you into belgium in the fall. And i don\u2019t touch holland, kiel, or berlin. And russia doesn\u2019t either. Maybe we get italy to move to Pie?", "Hi. I\u2019m guessing the move to HEL was to cut support. Should have let you know I was moving out. Are you still interested in collaboration for survival? We\u2019re both a bit threatened right now.", "Hi\u2014yeah, because of bot troubles I never got reassured last turn that you wouldn\u2019t support, say, France into belgium or something. So now here we are! France asked me to bump Nth to cut your channel support, just fyi", "To be clear I don\u2019t intend to do that since I basically need everyone to fall back to keep my holdings this turn.\nDo you have any clue what russia\u2019s plans are?", "Not sure what russia will do, but I\u2019d be a little concerned about berlin being surrounded. I won\u2019t be attacking Kiel so your support will go through from there.", "Does France think you\u2019ll be cutting support? Also, Italy has been sending some anti-french things my way. A three-on-one alliance could be good for all of us. Containing Russia may distract both of us if he gets aggressive.", "I told France (truthfully) that I couldn't cut your support this turn", "Cool. Do you need me to cut support in BAL or do you have that covered with Munich support?", "Also, Italy is on board with a stab against France.", "Italy told me that, too. And actually, if I could count on you to cut BAL support, it would free up Kiel to try and defend Ruhr from france for a turn. However, if you're using that denmark fleet for something else just let me know", "So I have kind of a crazy idea. I'm curious what you'd think of this.", "What if I let you into Denmark and I go for Sweden?", "Well, if France goes for Holland I'd be in a slightly strategically worse position.", "I was thinking you'd go from Kiel and bounce Holland with the HEL fleet. Then you get your build in Kiel", "that wouldn't work because I need kiel to support berlin, i think?", "Is Munich occupied doing something else? Italy told me he has no plans of cutting support there.", "Oh I guess Bur can do that though...", "that was my fear...", "Hmm... Yeah it may be safe to not do that then. Maybe next year. I may go for Sweden regardless. But if russia sees it coming and goes in, that could be a bit annoying", "But without action, Russia probably takes Ank this fall and builds in Stp.", "Is it worth losing the channel this turn? because you could take sweden for sure if you were willing to use nth to convoy", "Nth can't convoy to Sweden. SKA is in the way.", "doesn't need to. just convoy to norway and move your fleet from norway to sweden. then attack the baltic fleet from denmark. that way you don't lose norway", "BAL could move to sweden to bounce. only way to guarantee would be to support from Denmark", "ah crap you're right. sorry, wish I could help but all I have are land troops", "No worries. I'll give it a shot regardless. And if I do get the extra build, I can provide some serious support to your moves west", "Things are getting a little rowdy haha. The good news is that we both outlasted Turkey!", "RIP.", "go team!", "you held the channel! but no sweden yet...", "Yeah. I think the bounce there will be a start of negotiations with Russia. Clearly we were both on the same page.", "And you got holland back!", "ach but now there's French in ruhr that'll be a pain", "A bit. France starts to crumble when I don't have to support my fleet anymore, which is when Italy forces France to go south with its MAO fleet. Then I can start supporting your moves and we can get you into belgium, etc.", "Are you gonna try for sweden again this season? France told me that they're not moving their Mid-Atlantic fleet and instead would prefer to oust you from the channel. \n\nItaly gave me the idea of supporting your Welsh troops to convoy into Belgium. But if I did would you mind giving it to me in the Fall? I could be way more useful to you if I could build another unit this winter", "(I told france I'd interrupt your support from Nth in exchange for France letting me take belgium next round, but at this point I almost don't think of Belgium as being theirs to give, hence I'd rather work with you)", "Russia and I plan to repeat the Sweden bounce. If that's to be trusted, this frees up Kiel and Munich.", "I'm happy to give you belgium. My idea of the split is you get Bel and Par, I get Bre and Por, and Italy gets Mar and Spa. Obviously this won't all happen this year. But you in Bel makes sense long-term", "The convoy makes me a bit nervous because if France goes to IRI, they'll get a home supply center in the fall.", "Okay, no convoy then. \n\nHow do you feel about reneging with Russia? If you moved into the baltic instead of bouncing and I moved into Denmark (this is also insurance in case I can't end up with Belgium this year), I could support you into sweden in the fall?", "I'd prefer to keep neutral with russia, as fighting a war on two fronts would be a lot for me. Belgium isn't guaranteed for you this year, but I think it's likely. France will have to respect the pressure in the south from Italy. This frees me up to cut support in Pic and support you in from Nth. Then you just have to cut support in Ruh and Bur (if there's still something there in the fall).", "If France is honest with me, Ruhr will be free and Bur will be occupied. \n\nLet's be real here, though: Russia has at most two units to spare to threaten you, and likely not even that given the imminent pressure from Austria. I'm trying to work it out in the sandbox now but I really don't think they'd be an issue for you...", "Russia can support into Norway once he's in Sweden, and NTH won't be free to stop that.", "Okay that checks out. Thanks for your patience!\n\n...I was thinking of asking russia to support me into denmark this turn and offer to support them into sweden next season. I'm doing this a) to confirm for you that they're on board with the bump as you say, and b) to show that I'd like to work to build trust with them. However, if Russia already knows you and I are working together this will establish the opposite of trust. So I guess I'm asking if you think this is a good/useful idea, and also asking what russia knows about our plans?", "Russia can only suspect that we're working together at this point. I haven't given any indication of collaboration. I'd say ask away.", "Are you definitely committed to not cutting support in Nth?", "I really, really am. Maybe I'm just not creative enough, but because of my alliance with Italy, who is in turn strongly allied with Austria, I just don't see myself ever getting anywhere in this game unless I can expand westward into France. Hence, even though you're honestly scarier right now I'm inclined to be on your side for the foreseeable future. \nNow, you could just go copy-paste this message to France and I'd be royally screwed, so I hope that helps you believe you can trust me.", "Haha ok, glad to get the confirmation. On my end i\u2019ll confirm I am totally anti-french until France is out of the game. I\u2019ve actually ceased communications with France (maybe something we can all do once the stab is clear). I\u2019d like all three of us to get our two builds each together. Then we can look east.", "Russia's loyal to you even in the face of my temptation, btw.", "We\u2019re in a great spot. Belgium for you is a guarantee. Planning to take from holland or ruhr?", "Why do you ask? I assumed you were going to disrupt support from Picardy with a convoyed army while I disrupted Burgundy? That way you can still use Nth to support the channel in case France decides not to bother defending in the south", "I\u2019m a little worried that a clever france may let me into Pic, knowing that belgium is gone, and then move into IRI for invasion. I\u2019d almost rather cut Pic with the channel and risk losing the channel. And my favorite option is to support ruh to bel from nth, also risking the channel. The logic is that if I lose the channel, it won\u2019t be for very long, but if I lose a home supply center, that will be very annoying. France seems pretty upset with me, so a kamikaze move to screw me over isn\u2019t out of the question.", "Yeah, I'm getting that vibe from France too. Let's go with moving me from Ruhr", "Sounds good. Consistent with that theory, we\u2019d advise italy to support into Spain instead of Mar. It\u2019s a tough call though", "I mean, not really. The way Italy's positioned it seems like Spain is the only right call and that Marseilles will fall like a domino on a fault line next spring?\n\n...unless we could confirm that France really doesn't intend to defend. Then Italy could potentially swipe both in one swoop. But even if France is saying such things to me (and they are) it's still a risk", "Marseilles isn't guaranteed to fall next spring. Suppose Italy supports into Spa. France can block that supporting MAO from Gas. Suppose in the spring, Italy changes course and goes for Mar. France can then support Bur to Mar from Gas. Unless I'm missing something, it's a guessing game until you're in Bur.", "God dammit. Just when I think I get this game, I\u2019m still not clear on how the \u2018coast\u2019 thing works with fleets", "Do you think I could trust Russia not to try to swipe Munich if I tried to take Bur this turn?", "Yeah the territory can only be occupied by one unit regardless of coast. But a fleet must go to either the north or south coast. MAO can go to both. The coast matters if say you want to go from Spain to Mar. You can go there from the south coast, but not the north coast. And if you wanted to do this, you could coordinate a bounce with the Ber and Tyr armies so Russia can't sneak in. You're planning to sneak into Mun unsupported?", "sneak into Bur*", "well, at least to try for it. i hadnt thought of bumping with italy because i assumed tyr would move into pie", "Well your move only works if we let Bur into Mar, which means Italy doesn't try for Mar, which means pie would hold.", "oh i thought italy was trying for spa? or rather, wherever italy decides to go there's a chance it might work, and then they'd want someone in pie", "We'll have to see which move Italy wants to make. If Italy goes for Spa, the choice is between a hold or an attack from Pie. I would say a hold makes most sense for Italy if you've decided you're going for Bur. This is because the alternative may be a bounce with Bur and Pie armies in Mar that would foil your plan to get to Bur and wouldn't give Italy anything.", "Okay that makes sense then.", "As long as Italy doesn't want to try to convoy into Spain from Pie. Then Marseilles could be left open *and* tyrolia could potentially move into piedmont", "Yeah that could be an idea. Well, let me know when you hear from Italy. The good news is France will definitely be down one this year and maybe down two. And our progress will continue next year. At some point we should talk about post-war things.", "Does post-war things mean how we're going to deal with a seriously overpowered Austria/Italy?", "Yeah. Though the move into Trieste by Italy is interesting. I'm actually starting to worry about collaboration with France. Would Italy really be so greedy as to start a war on two fronts? Also, had you asked for a hold in Pie? (not that it would have changed the outcome)", "I asked but Italy told me that they couldn\u2019t guarantee they would or wouldn\u2019t, and I can understand wanting to keep that info need-to-know. But what makes you think Italy and France would collaborate?? Also, I\u2019m not so sure you should read that seizing of trieste as an act of war; Italy *did* help Austria take two supply centers this turn. Austria might have given it willingly", "*would or wouldn\u2019t hold Pie", "Austria expressed frustration to me about it. Also, Austria can't build. All of its home supply centers are occupied. And Italy only helped with one supply center, right? And yeah the France theory may be a little paranoid, but why would Italy make an enemy out of Austria now while occupied with France?", "What are your thoughts on the France campaign for this year?", "Also, italy and austria\u2019s stories about trieste don\u2019t line up. Italy says it was an offering", "Right that's what Italy told me, too. So I'm not sure. Can I confront Italy with what Austria told you?\n\nI will be moving Kie-Ruh for sure.\nWe can half-heartedly attack Pic this spring if you want (I'll move Bel-Pic, you support), though I doubt we'll get anywhere with it\nMunich will support Kie-Ruh\nAnd Fall I'll do a three-sided assault on Bur. \nNone of this is very exciting though.  If Italy can't make headway we'll probably be stuck in a holding pattern until you can shift some resources from the baltic.", "Actually, I got Italy on board to coordinate with us to leave one of Marseilles or Spain open for France to fall into. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you could try for Mao, or if not I\u2019ll try for Bur. Let me know which you prefer and we\u2019ll talk plans", "Italy is now saying that he told a secret that Austria didn't want him to tell, and that I shouldn't tell Austria that I know that Trieste was arranged... Sigh.", "I'll get back to you on MAO. Likely I won't, but maybe with very friendly Russian disbands. Trying for Bur makes sense.", "Well you couldn't ask for friendlier disbands than that! What do you think about making a play for MAO? What if I could get Italy onboard to support you in from WES?", "Also, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on taking Russia's northern holdings. \nOn the one hand, it's more power for you, but on the other weakening Russia is pretty much the same as feeding Austria.", "I'm nervous about MAO because I'd really like to keep holding the channel. Yeah I need to decide what to do with Russia. It's really tempting to scoop up some supply centers, but that would be the end of Russia.", "In other news, France (who continues to message in spite of my ghosting) just pointed out that Italy has a number 1 ranking on playdiplomacy.com. The username checks out, but that's about as far as I can verify.", "Right France told me too. So it may be worth reconsidering our deal with the devil", "I think France may still have to go though. We can't be both allied with France. Geographically it doesn't really make sense. However, me you and Russia vs Austria and Italy might work well for us.", "I think so too. But, realistically, as things stand now you, me, and Russia V. italy/austria just looks like me and russia getting sh*tkicked while you hang out in the back. So the question ought to be, can we afford to take down france before I/A get too powerful? Or is it worth it to put aside eating France to nip this in the bud?", "Russia's actually in a really good position if I choose not to invade. I'd have to go over the tactics, but I'm pretty sure that line will hold in the south.", "And then you can support Mun from Kiel.", "When the time comes", "I can bring my fleets around this year to support the attack on France, and that would put us in good position to face italy. But we'd have to play it off as just going for France until France is gone.", "but i thought you said you weren't gonna go for MAO?", "I won't try from the channel. But I can bring the Nwy fleet around this year.", "Why the fleet in berlin btw?", "Well I figured that I'd need at least one more eventually, and that since my whole northern border is coastal a fleet might be better for defending that. But it'll be all armies after this I think.", "That makes sense, though it does seem like it will be stuck there for a while unless you start coming for me and russia", "Well at some point we'll all turn on each other, I assume. But I don't see that happening for a while. Not til France Italy and Austria are dealt with", "We can always play to a three way draw! So does this mean you would be committed to a Russia-Germany-England alliance until the others are dealt with?", "And to a point you made a few messages ago about me hanging in the back: Dealing with Italy is going to take a lot from me. He's got the fleets that only I can deal with.", "Yes, that's what this means. However, Italy and France are both pretty talkative with me these days which could be useful for us. So don't go spreading it around that my true allegiance right now is to you and Russia.\n \nAnd speaking of fleet things: if you're not doing anything with Nth this turn anyway, could you help me out by supporting Hol-Bel? I think it makes sense for me to have a fleet with channel access in case you ever need support or a bounce there to keep France out. Maybe some sunny day you'd even trust me to hold it for you, though I understand if not.", "What sorts of things are you hearing from Italy and France? Also, are you talking to Russia? I'm planning to support the channel with Nth", "I just messaged Russia. I told them about your suggestion of a three-way alliance, and that I was mainly focussed on attacking the west this year but if needed I could readjust to spare somebody to support in the east.\n\nI haven't heard back from France yet, but I am sort of playing double-agent with Italy to ensure that France can continue countering Italy's Spa/Mar plays and it just looks like luck. This keeps Italy in check until you and I make progress in the north and are better positioned to push Italy back.\n\nI should have mentioned, but a third reason for the fleet build last turn was to keep France's trust. I figured it made sense anyway for the other two reasons I mentioned, but I did want to make sure France is willing to listen to me about Italy.", "Interesting that Italy was willing to give up his guess to you. I had considered the idea of feeding France info like this, but he wouldn't have believed anything I told him. And yeah it makes sense that something else was going on with the fleet situation.", "What moves do you have planned westward?", "Italy was willing to give up their guess because I requested that Marseilles be left open so I could take Bur, (which I plan to attempt w/ Munich this turn), and Italy agreed.", "Did italy explain why he didn't keep his end of the deal? Cause he moved to Mar", "no I mean this turn", "Ah ok. Cause we had talked about it last turn as well.", "Last turn they didn't give me anything useful", "Gotcha. Italy had asked me for support into MAO, which would not be consistent with that though.", "I did say no. Or rather haven't said yes. I'm curious about the timing though.", "Today at 5:11 PM, italy said to me: \"If I leave Marseilles open, would you kindly use Burgundy in the Fall to help me take Marseilles? (Likely that means ordering Burgundy to Gascony to cut support)\". So, it could be that both are true and Italy plans to do *neither*--rather than try to take Spa, Italy's gonna try rearranging?", "*5:11 central time", "Ok at 6:08 PM EST, italy asked about MAO. So that's around the same time. I'm not going to support MAO and told Italy as much.", "France would probably just cut in Bre anyways.", "Was that the reasoning you gave for not supporting?", "Just that it wouldn't be fruitful because France would cut support. I also said that I was eyeing it for next year (which will be obvious from my upcoming move of the Nwy fleet)", "Alright well sounds like we resolved that little mystery. Statecraft is exhausting.", "Haha yeah. I don't know if I would do online diplomacy again (I've only done it in person). I've spent wayy too much time thinking about this game. But it's alson been fun", "I'm prepping for an august in-person game I have scheduled with some friends", "I have also been spending way too much time thinking about this! Yeah the days between adjudications are just too much.", "I agree. In person is exhausting for other reasons though. You have to take a whole day out and it\u2019s much more stressful when you have 15 minute negotiations and everyone is in the same house.", "oh I didn't even think of the logistics of in person negotiating! So if you and Russia disappear for five minutes everybody knows somethings up?", "Yeah, and also you see little cliques start to form. Like three countries will get together and then go quiet when someone else walks in the room. And you can just shout stuff to the room if you want. Also tactical and order errors are more common. And intentional order errors are a thing.", "That sounds like a perfect storm of social- and tactical-anxiety inducing stimuli. I think the ideal thing from my perspective would be online play with three adjudications per day. So it's about the same level of commitment as a really active group chat.", "Yeah people get pretty emotional. And I do it with a group of friends too. We decided we could only handle it once every 6 months or so.", "three times a day would be too much for me I think. I feel like I wouldn't get any work done.", "I could see that. But sacrifices have to be made.", "Haha I'm NOT a multitasker, so I'd bet the sacrifice is bigger for me than it is for you. Also, I feel like it would be easier almost if I wasn't on the computer all day for work as it was. But having work and recreation competing for the same screen is really distracting for me.", "you just described me. and my situation. But I take summers as pseudo-vacation so there's not as much consequence", "Yeah that's not a bad way to do it. I'm a grad student in the same school/department as admin actually. So I've also got a pseudo-vacation not taking classes or anything, but I'm still trying to be productive.", "I'm in admin's department too! I should have realized: only grad students feel as guilty about spending time doing things they enjoy as you seem to \ud83d\ude1b \nBut back to business: any chance of letting me borrow Denmark? I figure that with Northern Russia out of the picture your fleet's just sort of...parked there. But if you let me have it I will either build an army in Ber to help out Russia or an army in Kiel to fight France with. I totally understand if you don't want to, though.", "Anyway, regardless of how you feel about the Denmark issue, I just hatched a plan to potentially help France keep resisting Italy, if you're game:\n\nTell Italy you've had a change of heart and want to support them into MAO this turn, on the condition that they free it up for you by moving to Portugal next spring. \nIf italy agrees, let me know. I'll tell France to put all power into defending Marseilles and Mao. \n\nThe hope is that since last turn *I* was the one who knew Italy's move and this time--as far as Italy knows--only *you'll* know it, Italy won't smell a rat when France is lucky in defending again", "No way! I wonder if we've been walking past each other in Iribe and without any idea that we're both in the study. And let's bring up Denmark again when I have another build secured. Who knows how long it will take to get into Brest.", "That's a reasonable plan for Italy. Let me get a sense of where Italy's head is at first. He may not even want MAO anymore.", "Can you explain the fleet move btw?", "Honestly because I thought you\u2019d say yes to giving me Denmark.\nI doubt we\u2019ve run into each other because I\u2019m in St Louis for the summer", "Yeah, we should have talked about that  before probably. On its own, the move has a somewhat anti-me connotation. And yeah I definitely have not been to St Louis this summer haha", "You're going for Bur this season?", "Sorry to spook you! And not to beat a dead horse, but: you claim you want to secure another build, but with your denmark fleet basically stuck where it is, it\u2019s not like keeping it is going to help you with that goal. That supply center\u2019s doing nothing for you except maintaining the unit bound to it. *I* on the other hand, could help you get what you want by getting another build.\n\nIf you have plans to use the denmark fleet, I\u2019ll respect them, because right now our goals are the same. But I see no point in keeping the fleet just for its own sake.\n\nYep, going for Bur", "Yeah I mean it's a bargaining chip. Russia has to be in my good graces while I have it. And it's something I could offer you in exchange for something nice. It's not clear to me why you need it right now. Paris has your name on it. You'll win the eventual for Mar with no trouble.", "Alright, that\u2019s a valid reason.\nI was feeling more urgent about it because I think it\u2019s paramount that Russia get some aid against Austria.", "Yeah that's fair. I think Russia is clever enough to re-instate the stalemate, though. Maybe I'll drop him a line to see what he's thinking.", "BTW italy plans to literally randomize his move choice.", "Thanks for letting me know!", "Nice job on Bur. Let's see if we can get you paris next year!", "What's your plan for taking MAO? If you want to move Eng-IRI I will support Nth into the Channel?", "Yeah i was thinking the same actually. Only risk is a bump in IRI i think results in dislodge of the current channel unit. I\u2019m willing to risk it though. France at this point is likely trying to choose who to annoy the most as he goes down. I have a feeling it will be me, even though i\u2019m not the one taking his territories so far. I\u2019ll probably go another year without a build unfortunately", "Patience, my tea-sipping friend \ud83d\ude1b \nBut if you dislodge trying to get IRI that means you at least got Nao, and putting the unit in Pic would help you take Brest anyway", "Oh i\u2019m planning nwg to nth so that i\u2019m still in nth. Do you think the brest fleet may move to Pic?", "ya know, if you'd just let me have Denmark back you could keep Nth *and* get at least one of Nao/Iri/Brest this year.\nI can keep talking to France to see where their head's at, but I think a move to Pic is probably not in the cards. If you were to predict it France'd lose Brest!", "Are you still on good terms with France? Was the move into Bur expected?", "It was, actually. France has seen the end coming for a while, but since I was willing to work with them against Italy while you two ghosted, they're more amenable to my invasion that yours or Italy's.", "Makes sense. Well, let me think about whether Denmark is a possibility (though I\u2019m still very hesitant) and get back to you. And I let me know what France is up to with Brest.", "Alternatively, why not just leave Nth empty for a turn? \nI'm working on figuring out France as we speak...", "Cool. And I suppose I could, though it does leave me a little vulnerable. Maybe we could talk a bit about what our collaboration looks like over the next couple of years", "Well, I can say definitively at this point that France prefers to mess with Italy over you. Basically they don't want to see Italy totally dominate this game. I encouraged this by saying that Italy's going to try for MAO this turn and they should focus on defending that. \n\nWrt the next couple years, my idea is this: it's crucial that you take Mao, and that I take Paris. From here, you and I can work on beating Italy out of the Iberian, such that you end up with Portugal, Marseilles, and Spain and I end up with Brest and Paris (though you can have Brest at first). From here we're well positioned to start hitting Italy on their home turf, esp. if Russia can keep hammering away at Austria", "...any thoughts on this?", "That all makes sense. Thought I'm a bit surprised that you'd rather have Brest than Mar. What's the reasoning for that preference? And how long would you let me hold onto Brest?", "I figured this split would give you land and sea options for attacking italy and not for attacking me. But I was just spitballing, and it may make more sense to divide it your way...And you could hold Brest until we were the only two in all of France and Spain, I suppose", "have you made a decision yet about what to do about Nth?", "I prefer to do the same moves as last time. So Nth would be a hold. I don't think MAO is going to IRI or NAO. But you would have the inside scoop.", "What would you do with Bel if it was freed up?", "Wait when you say Nth is a hold, do you mean you *don't* want to try for IRI like we talked about, and you're just holding the channel?", "That\u2019s what i\u2019m thinking now, yes", "*just holding the channel and convoying to Brest?\n\nAnd if by \"it\" in \"what would you do with Bel if it was freed up?\", you mean Nth, then probably move it to Pic in case France tries to bounce me out of Paris. But it might make more sense for you to just convoy to Pic, in which case Bel could support you into Pic", "oh nevermind you mean \"what would you do with Bel if Bel wasn't supporting Nth\"? Well, my answer still applies", "...Would you like me to support your army into Pic?", "That army isn\u2019t leaving the island until france\u2019s fate is sealed. Otherwise I open up my home centers to France.", "but you did convoy to brest last time? Was that just because you were sure the army would bounce? \n\nSo then basically everyone's holding still except you're poking Nao?", "Yeah that\u2019s my plan. The convoy was because if it worked, I could just build on the island and be fine. But i\u2019m taking on a risk if i can\u2019t guarantee the build.", "ohh gotcha. I'm moving Bur-Par, Ruh-Bur. Everyone else is just staying put", "I really am curious about your relationship with France btw. Italy mentioned that you asked him recently whether collaboration with France was ok. But what could that mean unless it was against me?", "\ud83d\ude44 Italy said that you were plotting against me, too! They're just trying to make us suspicious of each other!", "So you\u2019re saying italy lied to me? I\u2019m gonna make you click that thumbs down if you\u2019re trying to fool me here.", "Well, no. It's true that I asked Italy about collaborating with France, but only because France wanted us all to be able to talk about its last will and testament together. I didn't bother asking you because you had been pretty clear on ghosting France, but I wasn't sure whether Italy was or not til I asked", "But it's very possible that Italy took this fact and warped it to make you suspicious of me", "So, while we're at it, is there anything you might have said to Italy to indicate you were planning to turn on me?", "Well i\u2019m glad i asked the follow up question. Did italy agree to being part of this discussion? And how did the discussion turn out. Is France going to take out his anger on me with a final stab? Are you going to help him? And yeah i\u2019ve absolutely been talking up anti-german things to italy. I want him to be confident in where i stand so he doesn\u2019t expect a stab.", "Oh italy said \"I don't trust France\" and that was the end of it. So no, there didn't end up being a discussion except me telling France that you're gunning for Brest (which was obvious anyway), and that Italy's shooting for Mao this turn (which may or may not be true--but by this time you and I were strategizing and I wanted to keep France out of our way). \nIf france *is* planning to stab you, they're intentionally throwing me off the scent. Which would be surprising but not unheard of. So no, I'm not planning to help in a stab I know nothing about.", "Well, to be clear, another consequence of my and France's conversation was that France is just letting me walk into Paris this turn (unless they're gonna stab me but I doubt it)", "Yeah i believe that. So i guess it\u2019s just giving italy a hard time then, or maybe some unexpected movement north. Has italy talked to you about attacking me?", "Post-france?", "Well yeah. In the same convo where they said you were plotting to stab me they gave some reasons why it's better for me to side with them than with you. So no specifics but Italy clearly wants us against each other. But I don't think either of us stand a chance if we fall for that.", "*no specific attacks were suggested, I mean", "Gotcha. Well i think we have to acknowledge that our alliance would be sort of geographically awkward. I think that makes the alliance stronger actually, but we should be honest with each other about an exit that gives each of us a fair shot in the endgame.", "okay...well, as the person who has ever seen an endgame before, what do *you* suggest?", "I think we agree to coordinated actions until italy is dealt with. I think you in brest is actually more fair, although less ideal for me. I think we need to pick a victor of the russian-austrian war. Austria is an easier pick because i can take russian dots and austria can help with italy.", "Alright. But it will be harder to flip Austria against Italy, I think.", "Nah, i\u2019ve been working on it a bit, and it\u2019s only natural once his current conflict is mitigated somewhat", "I think between us we should find a split of dots we feel comfortable with. Not that it can\u2019t change in future negotiations. But i think it\u2019s easier to stay friends when the end seems fair from the get-go", "We don\u2019t have to do this tonight, but soon.", "Okay, soon. Glad we had this talk \ud83d\ude03", "Fwiw i\u2019m a relative first-timer too. I\u2019ve played two or three times in person, and the first time we didn\u2019t finish. I think everyone else plays a lot more. Would be nice to make this an underdog story.", "Regardless of which way it falls in the end.", "I think so, too. And Italy is like the over-est of dogs.", "You lost me haha. The over-est of dogs?", "like, the opposite of underdog would be overdog. And Italy is the most over-est overdog there is.", "*the overwolf, perhaps", "Haha gotcha. Do we think he\u2019s actually the number 1 guy like france said? He denied it to me. But the username lines up.", "I think it's more probable than not. Although, I also think it's really unfair to have that information leaked when other players get the benefit of a clean slate. That said, just looking at the way Italy moves and talks it's clear that they know what they're doing", "Yeah he\u2019s definitely a good player. All the better when we take him down.", "ugh I really wish everyone'd stop using *he* all the time. France and Italy know each other from outside this game, but it irks me that \"he\" seems to be the default. Out of curiosity, do you/others use \"she\" when referring to me?", "I had been using \u201cthey\u201d, but then i stopped once i saw other people using gendered pronouns. My rationalization was that the other players must have been confident in their correctness to start using them, but obviously that\u2019s not true. We use \u201cshe\u201d for you. France said it to me first i think. Happy to commit to being gender neutral in future negotiations (with all players)", "I didn\u2019t mean to be directive\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter that much to me, but it makes me feel better if I know people aren\u2019t just doing it mindlessly, and are actually matching it to players they know. I never specified to France that I use \u201cshe\u201d but my username is feminine so it was a fair assumption.", "Yeah that\u2019s totally fair. I will admit I had floated the idea of trying to play feminine and flirt with one of the probably straight male players to gain favor. The username\u2019s a giveaway though. And that might be taking things too far haha.", "That can\u2019t possibly actually work, can it? The flirting, I mean. This is a serious game for serious-minded individuals \ud83d\ude1b", "...\u201d, she writes, before adding a playful emoji at the end.", "All\u2019s fair in love, war, and diplomacy \ud83d\ude09", "Ouch! Still open to collaboration, but we\u2019ve got some trust building to do", "I wasn't sensing any trust from you, either: you were unwilling to return Denmark or to leave Nth empty, and you're right about our alliance being geographically awkward. \n\nI want to be a good ally with you, but the difference between you and me is that you get a cozy corner of the map and I'm right in the middle. I need to be able to grow my army to defend all my various borders. So I'm asking for Denmark a little less politely.", "Well now you've seen me make exactly the moves that I said I would, so hopefully you have some trust in me. I see what you mean about the cozy corner, but coziness has its disadvantages as well. Once somebody gets on the island, it's a really bad time. And I need fleets or convoys of armies to get anywhere off the island. Makes expansion difficult.", "As far as denmark, the aggression there is fair. But you understand why I'm hesitant to drop down to 4 dots at this point in the game. Fortunately, there's an opportunity to do business here now that you're adjacent to Brest.", "I'm definitely a bit upset about the support into the channel you gave and all of the lying. You didn't need to lie about your moves to amp up the aggression on denmark: I never asked for a full list of moves.", "That's true, I was overcompensating because it really seemed like your trust in me was low.", "Well, it's a vicious cycle. Mistrust breeds mistrust. So how can I trust now that you're not just going to continue working with France on an invasion?", "Because France is literally about to not exist, for one. And for another, because Italy is planning something that will be bad for both of us.", "Planning something specific that you know about?", "Yes. But I was told specifically not to tell you so I need you to not mention it to any other players. I know that's a hard sell coming from me, but I need you to promise.", "Alright. It\u2019s a promise. Who\u2019s the info from?", "Doubly confirmed by France and Italy. They've reached an agreement to give Italy the channel. When I confronted Italy about it, Italy said they wouldn't do it if I didn't want them to, but also admitted that they wouldn't have told me about it if I hadn't asked.", "But France also told me they would reneg on Italy if I asked. So, on the one hand, I could tell italy to call it off and things could proceed some unknown way. On the other, I could get France to reneg, and the three of us could turn this to our advantage. What do you think?", "It\u2019s certainly possible this is true. Though italy had told me he was actively deceiving France into getting the brest unit to do something unusual", "So if Italy is truly going for the channel, he went so far as to cover his tracks by warning me he may have suggested something like this to France", "To what extent has italy communicated plans of an alliance with you?", "I mean that doesn't seem out of the question for Italy. Italy has told me point blank that if it's a choice between you or me, they'd choose me. I'm sure they've said the same to you.", "Did he give any reasoning for that choice?", "Some bull about how I'm an honest communicator. That raised a red flag for me because Italy's too smart to need honesty from me. You're the better strategic choice. \n\nSo, it's entirely possible that Italy fed me this plot through France as some kind of ploy. And even that the two of you are already working closely together to ruin me, although I do hope that's not the case.", "I agree with all that. I\u2019m just trying to tease out who he\u2019s lying to, as that may provide some advantage. Honestly he\u2019s been more pro-English than anti-German in his communications with me. I think he maybe just doesn\u2019t want me to go tattle to you though.", "So what moves would you want to see from me this fall?", "I'll tell Italy the deal is off, then you move Den-Nth, Nth-Eng (supported by Bel), Eng-Bre (supported by Paris). Mao will take Portugal and you'll take Mao? I know you'll have to trust my support in two places, but it's worth it to me to get two builds this turn  without a fuss and keep Italy localized to the south.", "Did italy tell you MAO would take Portugal?", "No. I haven't given them my opinion on the channel deal yet. But that would be what I'd suggest they do instead", "Alright. Would you be able to confirm that this is where MAO would go before I agree to a deal?", "I just sent Italy a message about it, so I'll see what they say.", "What has Italy been saying to you lately, by the way?", "He suggested some defensive tactics to me.", "Defensives against me? in Denmark? Or France in Iri? Or both?", "Both. He\u2019s under the impression that we are not friendly after those last moves. I don\u2019t plan to take his suggestion though", "I'm wondering if these defenses involve you not supporting Eng, which would kind of half-confirm the plot.", "They do involve me not supporting Eng.", "Italy said they are busy this weekend (hard for me to imagine people having a life, but it must be so) and won't get back to me til monday.", "Gotcha. I\u2019m playin dnd this weekend, but i\u2019m not sure that quite counts as having a life). I\u2019ll probably be mostly offline through sunday evening just cause i really need a break from this game", "Umm the plan doesn't work btw. Gas is just going to cut the Par support that you promised me (this is the only useful thing it can do). So, no deal, unfortunately. I'll see if I can get last minute support in from Italy and let you know.", "I really don't think an attack from Gascony would be an issue, but I understand that your trust in France is much lower than mine. We could still work together somehow, though?", "In a tactical sense, anything else from Gascony would be a misfire. So not cutting the Paris support is just giving up Brest. I really don't think France is just going to hand Brest to me. I'm still waiting to see if I can get Italian support, in which case we're back in business. The alternative would be a more defensive move on my part (i really don't want to go down to 4 dots at this phase in the game).", "Ok. Hope you'll see this before noon. Italy has agreed to support into Bre. I also require Par support for this to go through. Do you agree to provide Par supports channel to Bre and Bel supports Nth to Channel? I will vacate Denmark if so", "Ok, well if I don't hear from you in the next couple of minutes, I won't assume the support and will play defensive.", "Sorry I'm trying to get verification from Italy but they're not responding. That's a good default plan", "I don't think you're going to get verification from Italy. Italy is online and talking to me though.", "Ok do I have your supports?", "Yes", "Deal on!", "Yep, Denmark going to Nth.", "got Italy confirmation...hope this goes through", "drum roll......", "Yay!", "wow an 11th-hour three-power deal (with a decieved france as a fourth) that actually went through as planned!", "Yeah. And although we had our hiccups, this was really about as good as we could have hoped the takedown to be from the beginning.", "do you think there's a chance Italy would give you Mao willingly this turn?", "There's a chance. I'm surprised by the fleet build btw.", "My plan is to eventually have only fleets along my northwest coast (they're more versatile in that context) and move the armies inland. \n\nSee what you can negotiate with Italy, but no matter what they say, I'd be prepared to use your full strength to get Nao into Mao, if that's what you want to do. (And in case it's not obvious, it's what *I* think you should do)", "To that end, I can support Eng  and Bre holding.", "I appreciate the supports. Any idea what trouble France will be trying to cause?", "I imagine you'll get a request about Bre.", "France and Italy are probably not working together after last year's stab. But France has asked me if there's anything I want Pic to help with. So depending on your plans I *may* be able to push some help your way. I feel like Italy's 10 units kind of speak for themselves, so even though you and F have had your differences there's a good chance F will want to help you/us as the underdogs", "Yeah I mean this turn I don't know what Pic does to help me. Anti-Italian moves are MAO as you've described. What are your thoughts on supporting Bre to Gas from Par? This would require a lot of trust from you, but would make supporting into Spa possible in the fall.", "Does that mean you'd convoy into Bre? Because I can ask France to support that!", "But it would also mean you don't take a shot at Mao this turn, which is something I'd want to see.", "In this plan, I leave Bre open. I suppose that's too great a risk with France there?", "Well, especially if I'm asking for France's help, yeah. But even without revealing the plan, I still think it's a risk.", "Could you ask france for support into the channel maybe?", "Or say that you'll support France in?", "hmmm that could work! Then we only have to trust that Italy won't try and take Brest. Which isn't too far fetched since they *just* helped you take it", "Hmm, no there's an issue with the retreat if I dislodge MAO.", "Here's an idea. Tell France you're supporting Pic to Bre. Then just bounce Par in Bre.", "Elegant. I like it.", "Italy goes to IRI, but I can defend with the wales army", "Any thoughts on Russia btw? I imagine Swe is tempting", "It *is* tempting, but I'm not trying to fight Italy and Russia at the same time. And Russia's been pretty honest with me. So I'll leave it for now.", "That's fair. Any intel on italy btw? Where do your relations stand?", "Italy doesn't tell me anything unless they have something to gain from me. I asked if they were going to try and take the channel again and they denied it, but that could be fake news?", "Take it with French support? Otherwise it wouldn't make sense", "Well, I suppose I'm comfortable that Italy sees me as a friend on the board.", "You're right that *if* italy were to try that again, it would take a lot of negotiating to get France's favor. So probably you're right to not be concerned.", "Alright. I\u2019ll be somewhat not available this evening, so can you confirm moves to make sure we\u2019re on the same page?", "Paris supports Bre-Gas, Bel supports Eng holding, Ber-Mun, Mun-Bur", "WAIT NO (sorry I was making pie and lost track of this game): I'm waiting on confirmation from France about Pic-Bre, which I will bounce with Par-Bre", "making piedmont?", "And no worries", "haha I wish", "peach piedmont", "Sounds delicious", "France confirmed the move to Bre so the plan is a-go", "Ouch again! Care to have a chat?", "well you weren't exactly truthful either!", "I think we may need to face the fact that we're just not a good match", "I suppose you\u2019re not interested in what I have to say then?", "No I am. Alls i\u2019m saying is that we should both be taking grains of salt with each others\u2019 words", "Yeah that\u2019s fair. With what i\u2019m about to disclose, regardless of whether you believe it or use the knowledge against me, I would ask that it be confidential from anyone else on the board (including the fact that I\u2019m asking for this confidentiality). I know you\u2019ve sent plenty of lies my way, but if you agree i\u2019d really like it to be the truth this time.", "I promise not to mention it to anyone else; let\u2019s hear it", "Ok just to be really specific about it: Can we agree on the story that we ceased communications. You said we\u2019re not a good match and I said \u201csuit yourself\u201d and that was it? And can we also promise to not make the communication obvious without saying it exactly (e.g. \u201csomeone told me xyz\u201d when only I could have known). And to be clear i\u2019m agreeing to the confidentiality as well.", "Okay, sure. But there\u2019s something I want to know (and I\u2019ll keep my agreement now no matter what the answer):\nDid you in any way indicate to Italy that you knew/suspected the channel plot last year?", "No, he revealed the channel plot to me without me asking", "This was after you told me about it", "Well that makes no sense, because after I revealed it to you, Italy reiterated to me that they really did not want you to know about it.", "I think Italy wanted to be the one to tell me so he would keep my trust. I\u2019d have to look to see whether this was revealed before or after Brest went through, but I know at least that before Brest I was confident he wasn\u2019t going for the channel.", "Well anyway, what did you want to tell me? It stays between us, guaranteed, but I would reserve the right to move according to this information if I think it necessary", "Yeah that's totally fine. So last night I made a deal with the devil. One that he couldn't refuse. It's a lie that I will uphold it, but I think it's a convincing one.", "Okay, go on", "I told italy I would do everything in my power to get him the game. In exchange I asked to 1) be kept alive until the end and 2) get tips from him on how to play the game before my upcoming in-person game. I told him that MY win is about getting the best experience from this game so that I'm prepared for the in-person game (this is kind of true).", "Since then he's told me some pretty interesting things. I'll send you some quotes.", "\"that thing France said about my past successes: that was true. I do have a lot of experience and I have had a fair amount of success playing online diplomacy. I just did not want you thinking of me that way.\"", "\"I\u2019ll also note, just cause I have nobody else to talk with about this: I worked REALLY hard on this last move. Germany wanted to take Brest, but if that happened, it would have cut support and prevented your army from leaving your island. So I had to convince Germany to support France to Brest, without telling her the real reason why. And I needed you to go to NAO so that you could not guard Liverpool. There were so many lies!\"", "\"To be completely honest, I directed just about everyone else\u2019s moves on that turn! Russia is the one exception, but I basically knew what he was going to do. The best advice I have for someone who wants to get better at Diplomacy: just work hard. You can win by putting in more time and effort than everyone else. I have success by writing a lot to everyone all the time.\"", "\"I\u2019m not going to lie about my moves to someone unless I am going to get a huge advantage out of it. But I spend most of the game trying to make everyone else on the board feel that I\u2019m their closest ally, so a lot of what I say is a shade on the truth.\"", "That's what I got.", "And if italy continues to talk this way, I might have more to share, and would be happy to share it.", "Damn that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for sharing!\nDid he say why he was so keen to have your army on the mainland?", "It's so it's not on the homeland.", "I\u2019m surprised you were willing to do that. Why?", "Italy promised me Paris. You were going to go to Nth from Bel, and then France was going to retreat to Bel.", "Oh so italy screwed you! \nHe\u2019ll do the same to me when the time comes. \n...would you be willing to give me some warning of when that is, if you\u2019re involved in it? Ya know, just for the fun of sticking it to a master manipulator?", "I'd obviously prefer something a bit more collaborative than that. Italy will be at 12 SUPPLY CENTERS this fall. I'm not giving up on a mutually beneficial relationship here. Especially given that I may have some inside scoop from Italy for a while.", "13 if I help him into Brest.", "Well look, England, given that Italy or you could be talking crap at any moment, I see taking your supply centers as a more certain path to my survival than having your/his information. If you are actively going to help him take supply centers, then at best you\u2019re surviving at the expense of making an enemy of everyone, because you\u2019d be italy\u2019s dog, not his ally. It\u2019s your choice, though.", "I've not lied to you once this game. You can check the record with admin after if you're curious. Have I deceived you? Certainly. But I've not made explicit agreement to moves that I didn't follow through with. That includes Denmark (we had discussed strategy, and I said I'd confirm moves in the morning, and then I just never did, which I know was shitty). So I just want to be clear on that.", "Don\u2019t quibble semantics with me! Deception\u2019s deception and we\u2019re *both* guilty of it. If anything, it makes me trust you less if you think mere technicality gives you the moral high ground here", "I'm not asking for moral high ground. I'm giving you my knowledge that my deception to you has historically taken the form of truth. If we work on being more explicit with our agreements, I think we can build trust there.", "And regardless of whether I'm italy's dog, I wouldn't be so sure of getting my supply centers. I can defend everything this year, and I may be able to hold you off next year as well. At that point, Italy's fleets may be in position to push you off the island.", "What I can't defend is Italy taking Liverpool.", "You can if you retreat to Edi?", "At least for this year", "No I can retreat to Skag if I want. I can bounce Edi from NWG and bounce london from the channel.", "So you're not saying you *cant* defend liverpool, just that you'd prefer not to. *Now* who's using imprecise language \ud83d\ude1b", "No I can't. Italy is in MAO. My army is not on the island. He can get there in one move and I can't.", "NAO*", "you *can* if you retreat to Edi!", "or york even", "Oh wow you're right. That was dumb. Yes I can.", "York doesn't work because the move is illegal. Can't go around the coast like that.", "Oh and actually I was right. Edi applies in the same way", "Cly is in the way. Fleets have to move along the coast.", "wait, I'm confused. What? The unit displaced from Nth. You haven't given retreat orders yet. Go to Edi?", "Ohhhhhhh of course", "A fleet in Edi can't go to Lvp. An army could, but a fleet can't", "Yeah, you got it.", "That confused me for a second too.", "So if you're willing to collaborate, I've got some ideas, and would want to hear yours as well. I genuinely think working with me against Italy will be a better long-term strategy for you than working against Italy or alone. Italy is just too strong already. And, as I've said before, I'd like to see an underdog story.", "right now my retreat is to Skag, which will not raise any alarms on Italy's end. Is this alright with you or would you like to see something different?", "working with italy or alone*** for two messages ago", "updated to Nwy. More friendly to you.", "Well, that means a lot. \n...I take back what I said about wanting all your dots. I'm waiting for Italy to get back to me about strategy for this turn, and when he does I'll get back to you with what counter plan I can offer. I think this is going to be a turning point where I either commit fully against you or commit fully with you, and it hinges on what Italy is planning. Just know that I'm not going to offer a plan to you unless it's a real one. No contract-law trickery, no outright deceit. And if you don't hear from me, well, it's because we've *both* chosen the devil and our own glorious undoing at his hands", "Haha, this is fair. Best of luck in negotiations. Regardless of what you choose, I commit to offering you any counter-Italy intel I can gather.", "Would you be willing to also hear a plan offer from me?", "I am. And it stays between us, of course.", "So, broadly speaking, the alliance would involve Austria. And that means moving against Russia. We have a huge advantage going into Russia, which takes pressure off of Austria and allows austria to put pressure on Italy.", "Alright--haha I was just in a sandbox ordering you to move to sweden anyway \ud83d\ude03", "Hmm, you might lose Munich this year though.", "This has been noted.", "No specific intel there, just saying tactically it's a possibility. I don't know if italy would go for that. I mean we had discussed someone going to munich before his stab, but I don't know if that can be trusted", "Well before you and I started chatting Italy denied that he had any plans for munich this season, but his word isn't exactly his bond", "Yeah, not sure what he'll do there. It may be in his interest to remain neutral. Certainly if he catches any wind of what's going on, Munich is vulnerable. Maybe something to consider in setting up next year", "We get to choose what happens in Brest, which is great. And then the tricky bit is figuring out how to kick Italy off the island", "mhm. I was sort of depending on getting a build this turn, such that I'd have someone around to defend Mun. So I would be sacrificing that by working with you. I can convoy Holland to York?", "Let's get you in Brest then.", "You'd still have to dissolve somebody, then", "Go down to 4, sure. But if I go to sweden I stay at 4.", "I would like your help getting liverpool back if you convoy there, as opposed to having you take it. However, your army will be a little precarious on the island and will need a way off.", "convoy to yor*", "the threat of MAO to IRI will be a pain, but I think we can manage.", "Right--I wouldn't expect to get to take it (liverpool) if you're handing me Brest. \nAnd if Italy and I \"agree\" to a plan where he does some supporting from Mao, and he says nothing to you to contradict that plan, would you take that as enough proof that IRI is safe?", "Yeah, that makes sense. I'll let you know anything I hear from him. He's been quiet this morning. Ok I need to sign off for like a while to get work done. My fall moves under this plan will be Nwy to Swe, NWG to either Edi or Cly, Pic and Eng support Par to Bre,", "I think the plan I have in the works might be better than yours, so I'll get back to you later!", "Haha alright. Better for you or better for both of us?", "Worse for italy, equally good for me, potentially better for you.", "Alright, I'll be happy to hear it.", "New confidential italy quote: \"I suggest that you take Sweden, and I\u2019m working on getting Belgium this turn too. It\u2019ll be tricky to keep Germany from defending it, but I\u2019m going to try.\"", "Did he have anything to say about you retreating to norway instead of skag?", "He was surprised, but not upset. I said my justification was that it was going to Sweden anyways and that I wanted to warm things up with Germany. Did you hear anything?", "Italy only just responded to me, so nothing yet.", "Still nothing from Italy, but if we *were* to have a plan, I think it should be this:\n\nEng s Bre-Mao, Bre-Mao, Pic-Bre, Par-Gas, Bur s Par-Gas, Nwy-Swe, Nwg-Cly, Nth c Hol-Edi", "Your promptness in reporting Italy's words to me plays to your advantage: if the next message from italy to me suggests I do something that leaves Belgium vulnerable, I'll pretty much be so revolted that I'll have no choice but to stab him", "Will continue to send things your way, though I\u2019m not sure how much more i\u2019ll hear. How come you prefer Edi to Bre? Your proposition seems to leave me more vulnerable.", "Also, thoughts on messaging to France? I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll ask Italy what he wants me to say, and I\u2019ll say that. I\u2019ll also tell you what I say", "Ugh I *knew* you'd say that. (The vulnerability thing). Note the plan also leaves Paris wide open. We need to *trust* each other. But it makes more sense for Paris to move to Gascony to put some pressure on or--dare I dream it--take marseilles and the southern holdings. Since France might go poof next near it is better for *me* to be there.", "And in order to help your ouster from liverpool I needed somebody on the island anyway. You're pretty much equally vulnerable whether they're in york or edi", "As for French messaging, I'm not really sure. I only just messaged them for the first time this season (they asked me first what I'd like them to do), telling them basically what I've told you (that I stand at the crossroads of either playing Italy's game or fighting back with your help). I'm waiting to hear which they think I should do. If you want to urge them to help our plot, that's your prerogative.", "France was expressing anti-Italian sentiments to me. Italy told me to respond anti-Italian, so that\u2019s what i\u2019ll do. My thought about Edi is that if you were to go to york and the rest of the plan stays the same, we get another unit to fight with. I could build an army in Edi, for example. Do you feel like you need Edi as collateral? I\u2019m with you all the way on this plan, so i\u2019m willing to be flexible, but I do like to understand what you\u2019re thinking.", "Same as I was thinking before: I need a build so someone's around to defend Munich. you were willing to part with Brest and let me into york, so I don't see why parting with Edi (temporarily!!) is really all that different", "Alright. Can we agree on when I get it back? And how confident are you in holding Mun this year?", "This just in from Italy: \"France is ordering Brest to Channel. Germany is ordering Burg S Bel and convoying Holland to Yorkshire....!\"", "And the follow-up: \"So here is the move: Norway - Swe, Pic S Channel - Belgium, Mar - Bur to cut support, Gas to Bre to block the Paris move. \"", "Italy's playing us both, you can believe that. He fed me the moves you specified, then turned around and fed them to you. He only gains by playing off both of us. Well, fuck 'em.", "sorry for swearing.", "No swearing is fine if it's against Italy. Have you made your decision then?", "And I'm a little confused about what you mean by sending us both the same moves.", "I mean he said \"here's what I suggest: [the moves you sent me just now]\" and I said \"okay sure!\" because deception is important in this game, i'm told. Then he told you the moves, then you told them to me! \nBut because he suggested leaving Bel undefended and you *warned* me about it, I had made up my mind in that moment.", "Gotcha. So we're both sworn to take down Italy? I certainly am.", "I also have a bad feeling you'll be losing Mun this turn. Have you talked to Russia about it?", "I'm going tell Italy I agree to the proposition. Sound good?", "He's as slimy as spaghetti al'olio and he needs to be knocked down a peg. Plan on!\n\nThere's nothing whatsoever I can offer russia right now. So no, I didn't bother talking to them about it. Either it happens or it doesn't, far as I'm concerned", "And yes please tell Italy you agree to those moves. I love a good surprise.", "*okay to be clear plan is not on til I hear back from France. But *I'm* on board.", "Plan is not on, but working together against Italy definitely on?", "On like beans on an English breakfast plate", "Ok, I'm going to take your word for it that English breakfast has beans", "What do you think about Par support Bre to Gas?", "If I get into Bre, this will leave Gas vacant. The planned Bur support of Par won't go through based on Italy's moves", "From italy: \"Germany is now fishing for info from me about our relationship. Does she know that we are still talking? I\u2019d like to tell her that you\u2019re mad at me and you will tell me nothing, but we must keep our stories straight.\"", "All I said was \"Do you know anything about what England's planning?\" so he has no idea we talk", "I just wanted to see if he'd be honest with me. Of course he's covering his ass by asking you first.", "Yeah I believe it. I'm going to respond and say that we shored up discussions this morning (which is what we originally planned the story to be)", "wait I thought 'shored up' meant 'repaired or fortified'? do you mean like 'shuttered discussions'?", "Oh you're probably right. I should work on my idioms", "I mean that you basically said \"I don't think we can be good allies\", and I was like \"But, but.... \" and you didn't get back to me", "lol so I'll make sure not to use the same idiom as you if Italy asks *me* if you and I talk!", "yep that's the story", "My reply: \"No, but I'd bet she'd assume it. We didn't have much to say to each other this morning. I tried to be friendly but she was kinda straight up about saying that an alliance wasn't going to work out. And I sent a message back but haven't heard anything. So I'd imagine she'd think I'm not just sitting here twiddling my thumbs. Up to you how to spin it though.\"", "Oh, and I'm sure he'll spin me something pretty, all right.", "Yeah, we'll see. And the Bre to Gas move I brought up? (repeating so it doesn't get buried)", "If we can trust Italy's reported moves, it's the right call. I'd say it's our best option.\n\n...and something that *did* get buried: I'm willing to move out of Edi during the upcoming fall. I'll dissolve my Nth fleet since its only real purpose was stabbing you anyway", "Perfect. And who gets Lvp next fall?", "And do you think France will do the move? I'd rather you suggest it so I keep a low profile.", "I still haven't heard from France. And we already agreed that you take liverpool.", "Ok great. I didn't remember if we'd explicitly brought it up. I think all of this will work out well if we get France on board. I'm attacking MAO from Channel in preparation for a supported move to Bre (Italy didn't mention the MAO moves, and I'd rather not ask at this point).", "OMG I thought adjudication was midnight tonight. We've got so much time. I'll be offline for a while (or I should be, cause I need to stop blowing off work). I've ordered:\nF ENG - MAO\nF NWG - Cly\nF Nwy - Swe\nA Pic - Bre\n\nBut we'll obviously discuss as adjudication approaches/we learn more.", "New Italy message: \"Hmmm, Germany is backing off the bait. I think we will have to change our plan.\"", "Well that's not true! But i *did* just disagree to something he wanted me to do in Munich...", "Hang on this is good: we're gonna see what his real priorities are! He wanted me to cut support from Boh, and I refused.", "\"Not sure yet, but she is not going to leave Belgium unguarded so that won\u2019t work.\"", "Okay so he's trying to get you to change your moves regarding Pic and the channel...", "Yeah. Will be interested to see what he says.", "Ok signing off for a few hours now.", "Okay so I'm trying a little experiment: I told Italy that the last message you sent me hinted that if *I* didn't work with you, maybe Italy would. I said that knowing this, I *know* there's more than what he claims going on with the two of you. There's a chance he'll tell *me* some \"expected\" moves of yours, and between what he tells me and what he tells you, we'll know exactly what he's planning. Or at least get a better sense of it.", "Nice. Ok italy\u2019s response is consistent with what you said.", "[sigh] please tell me you didn\u2019t tell him everything.", "Here's what I said, verbatim (it's long...hope it doesn't break the bot):\n\nBut England's desperate. Better to talk with someone than just go in blind. And I doubt they'd turn to Russia or France because neither is really close enough/powerful enough to give real help. And there's precedent for you negotiating with someone even as you stab them: France.\n\n...and here's the real accusation: for all your pretty words about a shared victory between you and me, you've been sneaky and you've always pitted me and England against each other to your benefit. My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so easy to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. \n\nI know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over. And I assume others are like me, hence I suspect you now. \n\nI'm offering this confession in hopes that you'll do the same. So just come clean and let's approach this thing as equals?", "I may have gone a little overboard but all my reasoning and everything I say is factual. So he has no reason to suspect you as long as you insist we don't talk", "Alright that adds up. Something about getting a message from italy about it right after you sending me that made me a little nervous. I\u2019ve explained that we don\u2019t talk", "I've confronted him before about deliberately pitting us against each other, so he knows I've always been suspicious of your relationship", "Gotcha. Ok he said that you were pressing hard for moves, and that he would respond that we\u2019re friendly but haven\u2019t discussed particular moves", "yeah that's been his line so far. The lying bastard.", "In fairness he doesn\u2019t know my actual moves haha. Still nothing from France? Nothing from my end", "Yeah radio silence. France might have a life/better work ethic than any of us. Or maybe just doesn't care about this game anymore.", "Haha yeah. Well if we hear nothing that may be cause for concern. If i\u2019m not in brest this fall, i\u2019ll have a disband", "But speaking of work ethic, i am gone until tomorrow (for real this time). Let\u2019s reconvene in the morning", "Ok sounds good", "So...Italy really did not take kindly to my confession. I retaliated with \u201cif you don\u2019t trust me, so be it! But i\u2019m not going to just roll over and let you dominate this game\u201d\n\nYou can cement italy\u2019s trust of you in the morning by reporting that I\u2019ve approached you with a plan. We can talk about what form that plan should take, or you can just feed Italy anything but the truth. \n\nFrance is on board with the stab just fyi. Happy to leave Brest if they\u2019re to be believed, and I think they are.", "Ok. Where did France say he would go from Bre?", "Gas. That\u2019s still the plan right?", "Updates on my end: France asked for my preference on where to go. I told italy this. I asked italy what i should say back. Italy said it shouldn\u2019t matter because he believes france is lying.", "Yes, Gas is the plan.", "Well if you tell France anything other than gas I look like a liar", "I will tell france Gas as well. And it seems like italy is indifferent about what I say, so it shouldn\u2019t raise any eyebrows there.", "Now what plan would hypothetical you approach me with??", "I *don\u2019t* think you should tell italy France\u2019s real move. Is it too late?", "Gimme a bit to fabricate a good hypothetical plan...", "Not too late. But then i worry about what to tell France. I suppose if France is a spy we\u2019re doomed anyways. But it would be bad to be found out before the stab.", "What if i just don\u2019t respond to france?", "Also, i\u2019m going to ask italy for any update on the state of belgium as if I haven\u2019t received a plan from you yet. And then when we\u2019re ready with the plan i\u2019ll say you messaged me.", "If france is a spy we\u2019re royally fucked. I\u2019m 95% sure that\u2019s not the case.", "Please lie to italy", "I will. Should i reply to france though?", "Also i think when you have a fake plan, you should type the message up to me like you\u2019re asking for real. That way i have it on hand to send to italy.", "Okay. Please reply to france. I\u2019m going to sleep", "I told france. If italy asks what i told france, i will say something different. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ask.", "Hi England,\nI know that the last thing I said to you was that a partnership between us wouldn't work out, but I've had a genuine change of heart. The reason for that is that I think Italy is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized; right now they may be promising you that you'll take centers of mine, and maybe even that you two will share a victory together. This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago. But we both need to face facts: Italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between us, and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger. \nIf you're tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory. This proposal involves France, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Italy. Trusting them may be a hard sell, but so is trusting me. If I were really trying to trick you, I wouldn't ask something so unreasonable as that you trust us both. But frankly I consider knocking Italy down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing we can do to keep this game viable for any of us. \nMy proposal is: NWG-Cly, Nth convoy Hol-Yor, Eng-IRI or Wal, Bel s Bre-Eng, Pic-Bre, Par-Pic, Bur-Par, Mun-Bur (I figure I'm about to lose Mun anyway, and if that happens I'll disband my Hel fleet)\nNext year we'll be well-positioned to boot Italy off the island and the iberian. What do you think?", "(this part is not for copy-pasting to Italy) I designed this plan to make it look safe for Italy to convoy Gas-Lvp. I know this is what they'd really like to do. I think we need to do everything we can to try and disrupt this. I know it's a riskier move trying to assist Bre into Mao but I think it's the right one. I also think that for *extra* insurance NWG should poke NAO, because worst-case scenario Italy doesn't try the convoy and moves Nao-Lvp and also moves Mao-Nao to bounce. This guarantees Bre makes it into Mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings, and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking Italy out of Liverpool. In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build. That part of the fake plan is actually true", "Italy is telling me to expect a bounce in Bre. So that\u2019s not consistent with the convoy idea. Maybe he\u2019s lying?", "But i haven\u2019t sent the plan yet", "So all he says is \"expect a bounce\"? He could think *I'm* going to try and take it from you. And this could be further misdirection about the convoy.", "Italy can't make a bounce if we attack Mao and Gas at the same time, which the real plan has us doing", "That\u2019s fair, it could be a bounce we expect from you. Keep in mind that the French fleet disbands in the fall, assuming it leaves Bre. So if it gets into MAO, it will then vacate by spring", "Better to vacate Mao than Gas, I think.", "Hmm, i mean if we really think it\u2019s a convoy, disrupting the convoy is a great option. You\u2019re saying i support Bre from channel? And let me see how Italy responds to the message", "Yes, you'd support Bre from the channel. and Bel will support the channel.", "I also don\u2019t think hitting NAO makes sense. Then we won\u2019t be able to take Lvp next spring", "sometimes it's like you don't even read my messages. I acknowledge that. We'd have to wait til fall. I'm making a sacrifice too by convoying to york instead of Edi, and I'm willing to do that because I think it's the right move. Even if there's not a convoy, there's still a chance you fall into Nao which is advantageous.", "The way I see it we don't stand a chance unless we can take mao and start beating Italy back into the mediterranean", "You didn\u2019t make it clear that Yor was a real move.", "I said: \"In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build\", how can I get clearer than that?", "Whoops haha. I\u2019m still in bed looking on my phone and it\u2019s a lot of text.", "I know. Sorry, I get wordy when I'm on the war path", "It\u2019s quite alright. Do you think it\u2019s worth saying anything to germany? If you\u2019re confident that the convoy is the move, what additional edge do we get by sharing fake info?", "You mean to Italy? I do think it's worth it, because Italy will realize that I'll turn to you if I'm no longer allied with him. By reporting the plan, you cement Italy's trust in *you*. If you didn't report the plan, Italy'd suspect you. It also gives Italy a false sense of confidence in what I'll do.\n\nTentative request: after the stab goes through, do I have your permission to send Italy the quotes from Italy that you've sent me? Italy went to *such lengths* to defend himself and make *me* feel guilty for questioning him, and the sheer hypocrisy of it is so revolting. I want to throw his own betrayal back in his face. I figure he's not going to trust you after the stab anyway.", "furthermore, Italy may respond to my plan by offering *you* moves to counter it, and you can bet that the moves offered will turn to Italy's benefit. We can see if these moves keep you away from Mao and Nao, which will further confirm Italy's got his eyes on the convoy", "Ok i have to get to campus. Let me send the quote to italy and then i\u2019ll process all this and respond later.", "Oh and one more thing: as long as we think the convoy is the real move, we also know that Spain is gonna support Mao, unless Italy is really really cocky. So I'll need to support you into Bre with Paris to make sure you get there. This means Burgundy will have to try for Gas unsupported, but again, if we're confident the convoy is the play i'm willing to risk it", "I've told France the new move is to Mao and France confirmed. So, the moves the plan needs from you are:\n\nEng s Bre-Mao (Bel will support Eng holding)\nPic-Bre (Paris will support)\nNwy-Swe\nNwg-Nao\n\nLet me know if you take issue with any of these, or if you ever hear back from Italy. \nWe have a shot that at least one of these moves will get us somewhere. But I recognize this plan is nowhere near as sure a thing as if you just cooperated with Italy. I want to give you one last chance to back out.", "Alright I'm online now. Give me a moment to process everything.", "Ok, all of this looks good to me.", "Great! Note that you actually gain a build with this plan. So even if the move to Nao doesn't pan out, you can just build an army in Edi and use that to take back lvp", "Yeah that's what I'm thinking. If we dislodge the convoy, I get two! You really think Italy won't try to snag Por?", "Entered moves:\nF ENG S Bre - MAO\nF NWG - NAO\nF Nwy - Swe\nA Pic - Bre", "If they're convoying, I would bet not. If they're not convoying, then perhaps, but I think an open Mao is still better than an Italian mao. \n\nThose moves look good! No word from Italy?", "From Italy: \"Okay, I think that\u2019s the right move. This is the first turn in a while that is fairly unpredictable from my point of view. It would be really great if you wind up with a build.\"", "wait, he thinks *what* is the right move?", "I said I'd agree to your proposal but instead move to London and Edi, expecting one of them to bounce.", "Brilliant. Let's hope he buys it", "He definitely trusts me, which is why I think no support from Spa is a possibility. Like if he really trusts me going to london, why wouldn't he go for it?", "Also, I'm really hoping you won't lose Mun. That would cause some problems.", "Can you copy in your set of moves just so I can see the summary? If there's any you want to strike from the record out of paranoia, I totally understand.", "Full record:\nF Bel S ENG\n\nA Bur - Gas\n\nF HEL - Kie\n\nA Hol - Yor\n\nA Mun - Tyr\n\nF NTH C Hol - Yor\n\nA Par S Pic - Bre", "Cool. I guess the support in Bel is only relevant if MAO surprises with supporting Bre in or something like that", "right and I have a weird bias for having my units *do* something other than hold.", "I also wanted to talk post-war relations since you brought that up. My ideal would be total silence to Italy from both of us. As tempting as it is to gloat, Italy will use any gloating we do to convince others on the board that we're schemers, unreliable, sharing intel at an absurd level etc.", "We also should start courting Austria once the moves go through", "post-stab relations*", "we can try to court Austria, but should do so with extreme trepidation lest anything get shared with Italy", "Yeah no sharing of specific moves with Austria, at least not at the beginning. But the alliance is natural since I'm moving against Russia and we're both moving against italy. And we really want it to be a solid 3 on 2.", "Nicely done. Thoughts on the silence to italy idea?", "Also, austria just took a beating", "Accurate. We should sent condolences their way.", "And I won't speak to Italy", "Ok. I won't either. He's going to be sending some nasty-grams our way I'm sure.", "yeah if you get a juicy one send it to me!", "ugh I'm kicking myself I wish i'd supported Bur-Gas. But hindsight's 20/20", "So maybe try to cool it with Russia...I'm thinking we're gonna need to go 4 on one if we want a shot at stopping him", "Yeah i\u2019ll try to be amicable with russia. I feel like you\u2019ll have more sway since you didn\u2019t just take his territory", "Italy just said \u201cwell played\u201d", "Well he's correct about that", "And I'm trying to make overtures to Russia and Austria right now", "Haha yeah. I agree that taking down Italy will be tough even if he\u2019s operating mostly alone.", "Italy to me: \"Well, this game just got less fun\"", "Haha. Still figuring out what builds will be. Trying to piece together a plan to get you a build from Italy this year, but it looks like that may be a challenge. We'll have to make a couple of good guesses.", "I think your builds are pretty obvious, right? Fleet in Lvp, army in Edi? \nIn spring, I'll support Edi into Lvp. Meanwhile Lvp moves IRI with support from the channel and Nwg pokes Nao.", "With your permission, I'll move Nth-Edi and then Edi-Cly in the fall. This way we can shove Italy out of Nao come next spring.", "I agree with the builds, and I'll review the tactics. We really need an italian disband this year to break the line. With what you've presented we won't get Spa or Mar, and by next spring we may have Italy in Lyo and Wes. Not sure if we have a better option on our end, but I'll keep thinking.", "Right I don't think there's much we can do about the south besides get one of us in gascony and put a fleet in Brest and hope for the best.", "Nevermind: it's better I think to risk Italy in Nwg, since that's actually not a huge threat. Nwg should go to Edi and Nth should go to Lon. Dammit, we'd be in such a better position if I hadn't been so paranoid that Russia would move to Munich! Then I'd have kept my fleet in Hel", "Was just running through some tactics. I think I found an issue, but I want to check with you. Suppose Italy ends up with Fleet in Portugal, army in spain, fleet in lyo, fleet in wes, army mar. I think this is a stalemate line. And I don't think we can do anything to stop Italy from forming it.", "I mean you could mess with North Africa from MAO I guess. But at that point we're looking at Tunis as the next build on our front. And that only works if neither NAO nor IRI gets behind the line.", "Fingers crossed you can find a flaw in my thinking.", "I guess the point is that no amount of cleverness is going to get us those dots until we see disbands (if my thinking is correct, of course)", "I think you\u2019re right\u2014if dots is what you\u2019re after, you\u2019re better off stabbing me and Russia than collaborating. But I think you\u2019ll that just getting italy under control takes priority. Russia and Austria might see some dots, but if we do it\u2019ll take a lot longer", "I agree i could stab russia with moves on st p or something. I\u2019m not in great tactical position to stab you right now if i wanted to. No question that italy\u2019s the target. But we\u2019ll be dancing with those fleets until they\u2019re off the board from a loss of supply centers. That changes my thinking about our moves a bit.", "I know for a fact we can disband at least one of the fleets. I ran quite a few sandboxes in lieu of working today and I'll share moves in the morning.", "Yeah if you found one, that\u2019s great. Let me know", "woah, all armies from italy. I guess I was seeing things through the lens of the worst he could do to us.", "Given that the beta test ends in 1909, what are your goals? Just duke it out until then?", "was not aware of that! But yeah, I'll just go down fighting Italy like hopefully everyone else.", "That's pretty disappointing this game was just getting good", "Yeah admin said this in the general thread a while back. I agree it\u2019s a bit of a shame to see it cut short. But i suppose we\u2019re just the beta testers. I will be glad to be finished though. It was fun, but like WAY too much distraction and stress haha.", "Would you play online again after all this?", "I\u2019m not sure I would.", "I think I would! you're right that it's way too much distraction but, hey, it keeps me off the streets", "Hmm something tells me that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise be out committing violent crimes haha. But then again how well do i really know you from playing a lying game. I will say I\u2019d be down to do an in-person one with CS students at some point.", "Btw all other powers (me included) will be setting for a 5-way draw this move.", "I had been thinking the same thing! Do you know anyone besides me and admin at UMD who plays?\n\nUh huh...sureee they will", "AFAIK there's no drawback to submitting the draw order (if you're ok with the outcome). If there's not consensus, play just continues as normal. Well I think admin' adviser has played. I know [redacted] had expressed interest in playing. Not sure about students though.", "And I'm sure I could recruit a couple of non-UMD friends to play.", "I'm on board with the five-way draw, by the way. \n\nAnd I think there's a couple board game enthusiasts in my lab who may not have played this particular game before but would probably like it...if you don't mind playing with new people", "Yeah always down to play with new folks. And I\u2019m down for the draw as well", "Reply all to Italy's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the \"Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders\" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.", ":\u2019( we were supposed to hug it out!! Any idea who wasn\u2019t on board?", "Sorry for not coordinating moves. I really thought the game was gonna be over", "So did I! And I have no clue who wasn't on board", "I guess we try the draw again?? I suppose it\u2019s possible a game could be set up to not support the regular draw settings. I dunno.", "Not sure your interest level in the game at this point, but we should at least make sure italy doesn\u2019t win right?", "can italy take five centers this turn??", "Nah, but maybe admin will be like \u201coh btw let\u2019s go until 1914 now!\u201d.", "Any guesses on who is holding out on the draw?", "who keeps screwing with the draw though! Do you think Italy suggested it just to mess with all of us?", "oh haha we just asked the same thing", "That\u2019s my best guess. He\u2019s kind of the only one with the incentive to keep it going. And with his winning track record, probably the only one who cares enough to be this sneaky", "well I'm honestly not invested enough to care if that happens anyway", "I\u2019m not very invested either, but i\u2019d rather not see italy win, especially if this is how he did it", "well let me know if there's anything you want me to do, then", "Ok, will do. We\u2019ve got a day before the next move", "I think", "Ok would you be up for: Paris support Brest Hold, and then get one of your fleets into the channel? And then don't go to Nth as I'll be moving Nth to NWG and Denmark to Nth to make sure he can't break through in the north? Yor holds?", "Pic support Brest hold as well would guarantee that he can't take it from the channel.", "Pic needs to support paris but other than that Ok", "Pic can't, since it's a fleet.", "I'm supporting paris from brest", "oh right---ok thanks", "And actually can Yor support Wales?", "Yep!", "Great! Glad we're doing this since I think otherwise italy has a serious shot at 18 by the end of 1910.", "Wait I'm actually doing our moves wrong if we want to hold paris. I need to attack Gas from Bre. Otherwise, Eng cuts Bre support, Gas supports Bur to Par. So I'm going to do that instead.", "I'm doing my moves wrong*", "Par to Gas is a good move paired with that. Cuts support for either the Bre or Par attack from Italy, and the armies will bounce right back to where they came from. Up to you though.", "Looks like it all worked. A little surprised about the supported move into brest. Do you want it?", "Looking at the board a bit more, we'll have to be clever to keep Italy from any more centers on our side of the board. I think the following will do it: Bre and Par to Gas, Ruh to Bur, channel to MAO, NTH to NWG. We can ask russia to attack Tyr to cut support (Tri is going to fall anyways). I can hold the island as long as Yor doesn't attack me.", "The Brest support was just in case Italy moves Gas into Brest supported by Eng. I should have realized that with Lon moving to Eng that move would not have gone through anyway, but I'm not paying as much attention to this game anymore.", "And okay your plan seems to make sense but I'll check...", "Cool, sounds good.", "okay submitted those moves", "I'm doing same moves as last time, except for supporting Wales to IRI"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, true,

{"messages": ["Hey there. What are your thoughts on an anti-English opening, like a sea lion, as Germany? If you enjoy something like that then we might make good allies.", "Bonjour--not sure what a 'sea lion' is!", "It's when a lion is stranded at sea, like in the life of pi.", "That was a tiger. Let me know what you'd like me to do--I imagine it involves letting you take Belgium?", "Good point. Sea tiger sounds more menacing anyway. \n\nIt all depends on how you like to play Germany and your relationship with Russia. I can be flexible, and if it makes sense for me to have Belgium to set up for a future play then that is good with me.", "Admittedly, I've never played this game before! Don't go spreading that around", "You sound experienced for someone who is playing the game for the first time- I'm sure few people would be able to tell.", "I appreciate that, mon ami!", "Nice moves. What are your thoughts on the map?", "Well I'm wondering what you're up to in Burgundy, for starters", "Haha. I was looking to secure a position on Belgium and it seemed like the best way to do it. Depending on your plans, I could take Belgium with Burgundy, which could set us up nicely to work together", "Sorry for the late reply, the bot was down.", "I think taking Belgium with Burgundy would be wise", "That sounds ominous. What are your thoughts on England", "Any plans for Holland? Would you want to support Burgundy to Belgium? It's hard to read you and I'm not sure what you are planning", "So much for being wise \ud83d\ude02  \ud83d\ude02", "Can we have a conversation at some point? I'd love to figure things out with you", "Sorry--I was out last night and couldn't answer your questions!\n\nI was cagey because I still have no sense of who to trust and who not to. But I'd like to trust you if you think you can trust me too. I understand if not because of my unannounced visit to Burgundy...I was just attempting to have some insurance in case there was funny business", "Thanks for getting back to me- and no worries. Hopefully when the deadline is moved away from midnight it will be a bit easier lol.  To be totally fair to you, you never actually said you wouldn't move to Burgundy. For me it isn't a trust issue but a communication issue, which I think can be easily fixed.", "Have you been talking to England at all?", "I did: England tried to make a deal with me to take Belgium (I was supposed to support E's move from the north sea while attacking Burgundy), but we both reneged.", "I see. I ask since I have a feeling England might be playing us against eachother. He also asked for support to Belgium Lol. For now I'm building armies, but maybe we can get to a point where we can re-establish a border between us.", "I'd rather settle the matter of Burgundy diplomatically rather than with force. Any chance you will consider withdrawing from Burgundy?", "The one thing I think neither of us can afford is a war of armies. We would be giving away the entire ocean to England's units, and there's an Italian/Austrian coalition growing that will be a concern in the long run", "I gotta say France, right now it seems like the best move for me is to work against you so I\u2019m not so hemmed in.", "That said, I\u2019m no strategist. What are your thoughts?", "Let's say you built armies in Munich and Kiel and started marching in my direction. These armies can't go on water, they can't move past Gascony/Paris/Marseilles as my units will soon be there, and so the only places to go for your armies are Ruhr... and that's about it. Isn't this a huge traffic jam? Wouldn't you be hemming yourself in even more by building armies? That's what I mean by it will be devastating to both of us to get into an army war and let England control the entire ocean. We're bidding over such a small area of land.", "One option for we could consider is that I could dislodge your army and you could choose to remove it from the board. That way, you could build it in a place where you might need it more if you are feeling hemmed-in.", "No thanks, I don't think that's in my best interest right now", "Ok. Sounds like you've already made up your mind about things. Let me know when that changes.", "Not sure what your plan is. I'm covering Marseilles, Paris, and Belgium so you have no chance to take a supply center this turn.", "The bot was down but I meant to contact you earlier", "You put up quite a strong defense against me, which I'm sure was your goal", "I was suprised you retreated to Munich over Marseilles that one turn but it worked out for you", "I want to help you protect your supply centers if that is alright with you.", "Why do you want to help me?", "I'm worried about England, and you are frankly one of the only things stopping him from attacking me. I'm just looking at it rationally: what is England going to do with all those fleets? I wish we were able to work something out so that both of us would have some fleets at least. But rihgt now England has 4 fleets and you have 1 and I have 2. And he's going to blow up your fleet in Holland this turn, it's basically a guarantee.", "Let's say he gets 2 builds and builds 2 fleets. Am I going to be able to stop him, even if Russia and I team up? He'll dominate the entire ocean.", "At that point, it really won't matter how many supply centers I take from you because I won't be able to prevent an English fleet invasion.", "I mean, what are your thoughts on the whole situation?", "We should talk more. I'm not lying about wanting to help you, but it's hard because you aren't talking to me, and everything you have done so far this game seems to have been against me.", "well fat lot of good it's done me. I think you're right about the danger of letting England control the sea. But I'm not sure what I in my current state can do about it", "Can Helgoland Blight move to the North Sea? This would cut support, allowing me to take the English Channel.", "It could, but that would leave holland undefended", "Hmm. That's a good point. And Kiel is probably busy defending Berlin/Munich since Russia is in the Baltic and Silesia and could double team you with Italy. It's funny, there are so many units at your doorstep, but you might end up keeping all your dots this turn.", "I assumed you were working with England somewhat after last turn, since it seemed like he could have guaranteed Holland and chose not to.", "If supporting Munich is what is preventing Kiel from blocking Holland, I can support Munich", "That wouldn't be enough: I need to defend munich *and* berlin somehow and there's no way to do both without Kiel", "Yeah, you are right, I can't think of a way to do it either. No worries, we can try something next turn depending on how the moves turn out.", "Well. You did well for yourself that turn \ud83d\ude42. Really impressive diplomacy", "I want to apologize for entering Ruhr- I wasn't sure what else to do honestly. I should have given you a heads up and that's my fault. I'm sorry.", "And it's ended up being doubly bad as now I'm a turn behind in terms of defending myself with Italy coming after Iberia and all. sigh.", "I think we are at the point where we should talk about working together. If you want a decent result, I think your best bet is to work with me.", "I honestly do, since I think your growth potential is going to be limited by the fact that we both have way too many armies and not enough fleets. So this means that your growth is limited to Paris/Belgium, and that's if you make it past 4 armies.", "What I'm trying to say is that the big winners are Italy and England.", "We're the big losers. There's almost nothing we can do. Unless Russia, you, and I plug the holes in our defenses by working together.", "Have you talked to russia at all about this?", "What would you want me to do this year?", "Hi France--wanted to confirm our plan for this season and next: I disrupt Nth support from Holland, and in exchange you'll kindly scooch out of Belgium in the fall (into Ruhr, I imagine)? At which point I'll build a fleet in Holland?", "Actually, I'd have to build the fleet in Kiel, I think", "1. I have. We're both trying our best to defend ourselves from England- we're too far from eachother for tactical manuevering but so far we've managed to avoid any losses", "2. Despite Italian incoming invasion, I am still completely focused on taking the Channel, as that will give me much needed breathing room. If Holland can move to the North Sea, it will cut support and I will take EC", "3. I am withdrawing from Ruhr. I know this leaves me open to you taking it back and working with England to capture Belgium in the fall. I can't think of another way to get you a center, so my promise is that if the board doesn't shake up somehow I'll give you Belgium either this turn or next turn on the condition that you build a fleet", "That's correct, you can build a fleet from Kiel or from Berlin but not from Holland. You need to make sure one of those is vacated during the Winter phase. Vacating Kiel can be dangerous as England is in Denmark and could in theory take Kiel from you.", "I will vacate Belgium in the fall for you. Not yet sure what the best way to do it would be to make sure we don't lose it or Holland to an English fleet.", "I know England has their eye on sweden so we'll see how that baltic region shapes up next turn and that will determine where I build my fleet.", "it's risky, but I think I'll be safe leaving Berlin vulnerable to Russia in the fall...let me know if you hear/think otherwise when that time comes", "Will do. I definitely agree, I spoke with Russia briefly and I believe he intends to leave you alone from now on.", "Good guy russia. sorry if you've been watching me type, I've been starting to ask you questions and then confirming their answers for myself in a sandbox! \ud83d\ude02", "No worries. Feel free to ask anyhing- though the sandbox is really helpful too \ud83d\ude42", "Okay--real question: assuming you take the channel with Brest an then England retreats to London, aren't you going to just lose the channel anyway?", "oh wait nevermind I can prevent that if I keep my fleet in Holland and prevent Nth support twice. But this means I need to move Kiel into Ruhr during the spring to take my sweet, promised belgium in the fall. Picardy will have to support my movement of Ruhr into Belgium and you'll have to disband the unit. That's all fine, right?", "BUUUT England could foresee this and support with the london fleet and move with Nth...in which case, at least they lose Nth, I guess.", "Great point. I will have to disband a unit anyway in the fall after losing Belgium, so it won't matter if I need to pull it.", "Losing the channel might be rough, that's true. Hmm, I actually hadn't thought too much about it. I think if he does that at the very least I can retreat into Wales and threaten Liverpool (assuming that Wales goes to cover London)", "Give me a reason to defend myself against Italy. As it stands, I'm just going to let him solo.", "What do you think Italy is going to do once he kills me?", "Don't you agree that Austria will need somewhere to go with all his armies?", "I swear. I'm trying my hardest to work with you.", "Look. I will defend myself against Italy. But I need to know that I will be in the draw. If you and England are just going to fuck me from behind, then there is no incentive for me to defend myself against Italy.", "Hey, I really am sorry about the stab. You probably won't believe me but let me explain myself:\n\nI knew I was making a deal with the devil when I agreed to help England, but England, Italy, Austria, and Russia were/are basically all allied and I figured it was either you or me they turned on. The turning point was when I realized that after I stab England you might not even hold the channel anyway. I couldn't afford to risk fury from all sides. \n\nBut now I'm in a potentially very good position for you: England and Italy *trust* me. I am in the process of finding out--under no suspicion, mind you, because of our alliance and shared plans--their moves for this season. Once I learn those, I can relay them to you.", "Doing so would clearly be in my interest. The longer you're in the running, the longer I escape getting devoured myself on three or more fronts.", "If you manage to look just lucky or smart by making the right moves to counter their attacks this season, I can continue to double-agent and help keep you defended and possibly even expanded into England.\n\nI just spoke with England and I can confirm that you will be able to take the channel if you want to--they're supporting me into Belgium from Nth. \n\nI can't be as direct asking this of Italy, but I'm trying to figure out whether they're going to use the lion's share of their force against Marseilles or Spain. If I can figure this out you may have a better chance of holding.\n\nI'm going to send the info your way whether you believe me or not.", "Ok. I get that- I'm sorry for not explaining it well. Losing the channel doesn't matter to me. It gives me excellent retreat options and allows me to defend myself against Italy without worrying about what England is up to.", "There's no way Russia is allied with Italy and Austria. Just look at how aggressive Austria is in attacking Russia...", "Nothing can be done at this point though. Thanks for the offer of intel- this is basically all I wanted to hear. As long as I have a chance to be in the draw I won't give up and maybe something will shake up and give me a chance to recover", "You should work on England- he's not even communicating with me. I must have done something to piss him off. But if he keeps this up it's going to end badly for him too.", "For the future, let me know in advance when you are planning something like this. If I knew you were not cutting the North Sea I would have played this way differently by bouncing Italy out of the West Med, and we'd be in a much stronger position.", "It\u2019s not that Russia is allied with austria, but Russia is cooperating strongly with England to the point that they don\u2019t even talk to me.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I can confirm that Italy\u2019s going to shoot for Spain.", "(They meaning Russia. I get kind of annoyed with everyone using \u201che\u201d to refer to these players)", "I am sure Russia is just uncommunicative. Since the start of the game he's only sparingly talked with me", "*They've, sorry", "Just given that they seem to be fighting in Scandinavia. But you probably have more information than I do.", "By the way, what's the plan that Italy and England proposed to you in terms of your units? Are you attacking Burgundy with ruhr and Munich?", "Oh that's not a fight that's planned high-fives. At least according to England.\nNope--attacking Belgium with Ruhr and Amsterdam. We're in the process of discussing whether Munich should bother poking Belgium.", "Burgundy*", "I take back what I said about Italy shooting for spain. I thought it was decided but Italy wants to keep that decision to themself", "Thanks. I'm probably going to flip a coin for Spain/Marseilles. Has England expressed any concern over the Italian/Austrian growth? I worry that England has been charmed by Italy. Or maybe they just dislike me that much.", "YES! That worked very well. You're getting a build! Please please please build a fleet \ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude42", "I intend to build a fleet. Are you gonna disband Pic?", "woops miscounted", "disband nothing", "Yep, it got popped since Belgium had nowhere to retreat to.", "Neat, bot is back up now. Hmm, maybe it was just the one message that was bugged somehow. Whoops. I'll copy paste it back", "What do you want to do here? I am really hoping that we can coordinate something together. I think AI is starting to have some pressure put on their relationship with a greedy Italy. I understand England is in a tough position where their best move is probably to stay put and do nothing, which is always a tough sell (I just wish they would actually read my messages instead of sabotaging my ability to help them fight Italy)", "I checked out Italy's history. He's [redacted] from playdiplomacy.com. he's ranked the number one player on the entire site, and that's probably the most popular Diplomacy site of them all", "If we don't stop this here he's going to solo. No question.", "Sorry for the gendered pronouns- I keep forgetting to neutralize them sometimes since I've played with some of these players before in FTF", "Yeah lol. I'm totally fine with England in my territory honestly", "They have been fun to work with while it lasted, they seem transparent and honest. I'd trust", "Anonymity is tough to keep up with the discord names and the fact that the usernames are in the Backstabbr too. That being said, I didn't mean to upset you if you're uncomfortable discussing that- if it makes it better I have ignored it completely until I recently found out about the published names. It doesn't have to be a discussion point, it's pretty clear by now that Italy knows what they are doing.", "Haha. Fair enough, that is true, it is unfair. I'm totally guilty of accidentally assuming masculine pronouns in online games, and I'm working on changing that since it is a big issue. It's good to do as a default and I appreciate that you brought it up. I think Austria, Italy, Turkey, Russia, and I know eachother, albeit with varying degrees of familiarity.", "I know you were joking a bit when you said anonymity did you no good in this game, but seriously, I think you are playing great. I would have never guessed you are a first time player. Are you really sweat_smile? You are playing extremely well", "Any news from England? I hope that they will consider working to stop Italy", "I messaged them but haven't heard yet", "Ok here's what I  know:\nEngland is going to keep away from Russia's northern holdings for a while in order to avoid feeding Austria. However, The Norway fleet is headed for MAO for the start of next year, and England is very much still intent on seeing you consumed. Italy has told me definitively which of your centers is getting full force this turn (under some pretense about needing to coordinate so me and England could be more effective) and it's Spain. I'm going to hold and support Belgium and move Kie-Ruh with support.", "I'm also going to poke Bur", "Thanks so much for the info. Will do. Any chance you go to Tyrolia instead of poking Burgundy? It won't matter for me that much but for you it could save a lot of headache and potentially exacerbate AI tensions", "Alternatively a written commitment from Italy not to go to Tyrolia would be smart", "I'm not ready for Italy not to trust me anymore. I'll try to see about that commitment though...", "That turn went well for you. With Russia out of Silesia you certainly have more breathing room. Only downside may be Italy in Tyrolia, but hopefully they committed to not moving there or at least are aware that you aren't ok with it hanging out there. Thanks to you, Italy has ground to a halt in southern France. I'm hoping we can repeat it again this turn.\n\nYou should ask England for Denmark. If they say no, no big deal. But it should be yours- they are the ones that took it from you. And it's significantly hampering your manueveravility and ability to build units where you want to as it borders the extremely important Kiel.", "Italy offered not to move into Tyr, but gave a good justification for why they weren't interested in attacking Munich, so I let them.\n\nI just asked England about Denmark. \n\nAs for Italy, I'll have to come up with the right pretense to extract their plans again this turn...maybe you could help me with that? England and me are pretty much in the routine of sharing moves though so you're at least guaranteed those.", "Sweet. Assuming England/Italy want you to move into Burgundy, you could pretend to be worried that I might bounce you out of Burgundy and ask if Italy has some moves that can help occupy my units in Marseilles and Gascony.", "Any updates by any chance?", "I\u2019m waiting to hear from Italy", "Any info you think might help me in defending against England and Italy? My plan is literally giving you all my centers while Italy and England get nothing, since I can't defend all three and you are the only one who has been helping me.", "I'm assuming England is going all in and moving to NAO, maybe even to Irish and Channel?", "Right, England is moving to NAO but otherwise holding everything this turn. No deal on Denmark, unfortunately. Next year will be a play for MAO.\n\nAnd Italy is deadset on randomizing their move, so I'm sorry I don't have intel for you this time--I did try, though: England (at my suggestion) offered to assist Italy into MAO, but Italy refused.", "Thanks", "And as for me, I'll be taking Bur.", "Darn, that went poorly.", "It was a coin toss; nothing you could have done. I didn't foresee (or know about) the move to Naf but in hindsight it makes perfect sense.", "It's kind of a privilege getting to watch Italy play, esp. knowing who he is", "Yeah for sure. Hey but thanks for all your help. I'd have died a lot sooner if not for you.", "It's been a pleasure! Thanks for playing with a newb \ud83d\ude03", "If you're having fun, I'd encourage you to check out face to face games in your local area. Online is great, but FTF is really something else \ud83d\ude42.", "Anyway, I'd like to be a part of the discussion for how to distribute my dots. I'd ideally like this to go in a way where it sets up you and Italy nicely to take out England and Austria", "I see this game lasting longer if Italy receives as few dots as possible...what's your reasoning for favoring I over E?", "I am pretty sure England will stab you once they are done killing me. Italy has Austria to deal with. But England has nowhere to go. MAO is a huge stalemate line. Italy can litterally have a unit in Spain, Portugal, and MAO, not to mention Wmed and NaF, and there is nothing England or you can do to get past that line.", "If you and England were going to be a long term alliance, England needed to be in the MAO helping me keep the lines years ago. At this point even if I give England all my dots, Italy has enough units to the point where it's locked up. So that's the logical reason, but there's also the fact that England hasn't replied to my messages in over ten seasons and I have evidence of then working closely with Italy. I think that's a pretty big indication that they will hand Italy dots and have no intention or interest in working with me.", "In the end I probably am eliminated either way, so if you want to give England a shot then I can swing that way. But I'd highly recommend against it even though I'm sure you trust England very much.", "Okay, I see your point about MAO and England having nowhere to go.", "Thanks for disbanding Pic--that helps me out a lot!\nAre you speaking with Italy at all about your plans?", "Nope, Italy hasn't replied.", "Italy just told me as much too. Says they don't trust you...but your track record with me has been pretty good so I want to continue to work with you. \n...and actually, I've been seriously mulling over a backstab of England this turn and I was wondering if you would want to help. Specifically, if you think that MAO is destined for italy anyway, I'll support you into the channel. Meanwhile, I'll move a fleet into Hel and an army to Kiel to prepare to swipe denmark. \nI haven't entirely thought this through, but what do you think?", "That sounds great! If we knew English orders, we could potentially come up with an even deadlier plan. I'll have to think more about it, but if England convoys into Brest again, I could move Brest to Picardy to let it in, and bounce NAO. With Italy dislodging MAO, I could then retreat to the Irish Sea and take Liverpool while Paris, Picardy, and Gascony could reclaim Brest. This would have the advantage of not making moves that would give away the stab in the spring.", "So I'm Paris in that scenario right? \nAnd I'm talking with England about their orders right now. They want to take IRI this turn, actually, and want me to support Nth into the channel. If I agree, they actually prefer to move Nwg into Nth than try for Nao. *That's* how unwilling they are to just give me denmark back!", "Oh wow, I see. Hmm, well looking at the map I think this would still work. We'd need to find a way to make sure England can't take Holland in the fall (or we could just risk it). I think it makes sense to move Brest to the English Channel instead of MAO so that I have the option to retreat somewhere valuable (like into NAO).", "These moves guarantee Denmark but England could retreat to Sweden, which is something to be aware about.", "I agree about Brest-Eng. But me and England are still hammering stuff out so it's not final yet...", "Breaking news: England has decided (or at least has told me) that they don't want to try for IRI anymore. Instead, they're planning to convoy into Brest or Pic (I'm waiting on their reply to confirm which), poke Nao from Nwg, and otherwise hold/support as appropriate", "ugh. sorry but the plan changed again: England is going to poke Nao, but otherwise just hold everything. No convoy. \n\nI can still move Brest into the Channel if you want, and if you *really* want to irk England you can move to IRI. If I also set myself up for Denmark like I said, I'd have to move Ruhr into Holland to defend there, leaving my southeast pretty exposed, but I think that's a reasonable risk right now.  What do you think?", "There's also a nonzero chance that England is lying to me...they seemed pretty suspicious of me this time around compared to previous conversations. However, I'm pretty certain they're not lying about not trying to convoy; they're really insecure about you getting close to the island and not having anyone there to defend it.", "You're retreating to Portugal, right? If you can poke Mao from Brest, you may be able to defend spain. And if Italy does something crafty so that you end up falling into Mao, I can fall into/bump England from Brest?", "huh. So you *really* don't like England, I guess?", "Darn, I missed this message actually, I should have told you what I was planning. I think Italy had Spain guaranteed with MAO-Portugal and Marseilles-Spain with 2 supports. Italy actually then offered me on retreating to the Irish Sea, and in exchange we would collaborate on dislodging the English Channel. I figured it would benefit you as well since this would prevent England from getting off of the island (if they were to convoy to Belgium or something).", "Oh good--glad to hear Italy's talking with you! \n...but England could retreat to Pic?", "We're not talking much, it was kind of a spontaneous thing. You are right to be concerned about the retreat to Picardy. I'll have to see if that can be avoided somehow. If not, it's not the end of the world. If absolutely needed I can just not support the supposed Italian move to the Channel, which may or may not happen anyway.", "Anyway, you also have a guess- kind of. Not sure about what you've told England about the last moves, but perhaps they will use the North Sea to support Denmark to hold, in which case the support can be cut from Belgium.", "That was one of a few scenarios I was thinking about. But I gotta say, I don't like the idea of Italy in the channel. I thought *you* were going to be there. Did Italy give a reason why they want it?", "Is it okay if I ask Italy about it?", "That's fair. It might be best to not ask Italy directly, but that is up to you (just because it seemed that if Italy is actually serious about this proposal, they would want the element of surprise). Italy wants to do this probably because they want to take the gamble and hope that it will shake up the West a little bit. They didn't actually say that, but it is what I infer.", "I did end up asking...couldn't handle the suspense! And ever since I heard about it I've been wondering if there's some plotting I could do to turn this to my and your advantage at the expense of both Italy and England. Italy said they wouldn't do it if I didn't want them to...I'm thinking I could demand that they use WES to bounce with England in MAO, which then means that the battle for Spain becomes 2 v 2 and you keep it.", "That's really clever! We'd have to hope that Italy wouldn't move MAO to Portugal, but otherwise that works well.", "Meanwhile, I could support you into the channel from IRI?", "Sure", "Does that mean you are not going after Denmark?", "Well I'm trying to gauge E's trust of me right now, so I'll see and get back to you", "Any news?", "Are you going to assist Italy into the channel?", "England doesn\u2019t trust me, unfortunately, so I don\u2019t think I can swing anything clever", "I probably will. Do you think Italy actually intends to follow through?", "I think so from talking to them, but I've been wrong before. I've come around to the idea, actually (a weekend away from this game has cleared my head!). So, should I support Brest holding from Paris? Btw, are you going to let me keep Paris?", "Yep you can stay in Paris. If you can support Brest hold that would be amazing!", "I'll submit the orders to support Italy into the channel then and just see what happens", "I'm sorry, France, I made an 11th-hour deal (literally in the past two minutes) with England and Italy. I really really did not mean to deceive you", "No worries, it's the game, and I think you made the right choice. As long as you aren't afraid to lie to England/Italy :). I'm rooting for you to do well this game. Congrats on 2 builds!", "Thanks. I've learned a lot from you this game, so thanks for talking with me \ud83d\ude03", "Happy to. I still have one dot left, and it looks like fleet Picardy will be the most useful to you, but I can keep Gascony or something else as well. Now that all the French centers are gone, you will have to decide between Italy and England.", "I feel like Italy's 10 well-defended units made that decision for me. But even if I change my mind on that, I think Pic would be the most helpful to keep", "Me and Italy are strategizing now about ousting England from Brest/the channel. Are you more willing to support one of  those two moves?", "Actually, we could support you into Brest, then have you support one of us into the channel in Fall?", "Sure", "Moving to Brest right now", "Excellent! Do you and Italy have any kind of agreement about Portugal?", "Well Italy said that they would consider letting me keep it as long as I am useful :)", "Well this move definitely is. So I hope they keep their word", "Nice turn for you! I wonder what England will do at this point. Based on their retreat, it looks like they could be defending London and Edinburgh so a convoy to Yorkshire or possibly even a move to Norway seem like the strongest plays", "Can't believe Italy is going to get into Liverpool.", "Anyway, I'm holding in Brest for now, but let me know if I can do something else with that unit.", "yeah that's an unpleasant surprise. Has Italy promised you anything? Based on some things I've pieced together, I'm starting to realize the full extent of their manipulation of this entire game. It's honestly kind of unsettling.\n\n...I hope this can stay between us, France, but I've got two sandboxes up right now: one where I put aside my beef with England just to try and get Italy under control, and one where I keep dancing with the devil, which I will follow through with only on the condition they agree *not* to take one of Liverpool or Portugal this year. Neither of these plans has you staying in Brest. If you're willing to do either of those things (help with an Italy stab or more English destruction) at the expense of Brest, let me know and let me know which you'd prefer. If not, well, that may tip the scales to me staying with Italy, because I don't think we can swing the stab without your help.", "Happy to order whatever you want.", "I know there's no chance for me to live in this game unless someone else wants it. I think I may have some insight that's worth keeping me around. But if it makes more sense for me to go out now, I'll do it.", "You're good people, France! And I have Italy's word that they're not taking Portugal anytime soon. Though Italy's word is literally not worth the electric current encoding it. \n\nWhat insight are you referring to, may I ask?", "Thanks. I definitely don't want to see Italy run away with this game. Hmm, well I guess I may be able to offer insight in terms of helping with orders. I'm sure an EGR alliance can stop the AI. Mathematically we will hold 17 centers at the end of this year, which is usually the magic number to prevent a solo since you need 18 to win. Unfortunately, it doesn't leave any leeway to lose ground anywhere and more eyes on the map can be useful.", "I'm assuming Austria can't be turned against Italy. I've tried for the past couple years, even organizing a 3 way convo between Russia, Austria, and I. I don't think Austria is willing to stab Italy.", "I know I said earlier that it would make sense for you to work with Italy, though I've admittedly changed my mind. Especially after the last orders, Italy is nigh unstoppable if you and England fight since Italy will soon reach a critical number of units where they can defeat any opponent. Also, there are no easy stalemate lines in the West to stop them anymore really.", "It's ultimately up to you though. I could see a scenario where you work with Italy to take out England, and a well timed Austria stab of Italy leaves you to establish a strong defense and get a good draw result", "So, that's exactly what Italy has promised me. However, I know for a fact that he's (Italy has lost the courtesy of nonspecific 'they' in my book) been working with England and feeding England my proposed moves for this turn. (Keep that quiet, please!) \nWithout revealing that England has been communicating with me, I think I *might* be about to get Italy to confess what he's been doing. He's asked for a half hour to pick his kids up from school (despite my urging that he abandon them and respond to me now), and then he's going to respond. If he confesses, I'm going to side with Italy. In which case I'd like you to move into the channel (where both Bel and Mao [maybe] will support your move). \nIf he doesn't, Paris will support you into Gascony. Meanwhile Eng moves IRI and Bel moves Eng. In the north, I convoy to Edi (England's willing to allow me the build this winter) while Eng moves Nwg.", "Sounds good.", "I'm only talking to you at this point. No info will be leaked.", "Convoying to Edi sounds like a good idea. I don't have context on Italy's plan at all, but if I were him I'd probably convoy Gascony into Liverpool", "Italy is vile and even if we all die doing it I want to see him minorly inconvenienced. I\u2019d like to move forward with the anti-italian plan and support you into Gas", "Done", "Since we (me and England) think that Italy's going to try the convoy from Gas to Lvp, we actually think it's better to try and have you disrupt Mao. Eng will support you into Mao. Sorry for the late-breaking change.", "Ok", "Good game, France! Thanks for everything!", "GG!

{"messages": ["Hello there! What's your general plan for this game? My inclination when I play Austria is to piss off as few people as possible, so I don't plan on making any overtly aggressive moves this turn.", "Hey hey!  \nDon't really have much of a plan yet - like you, I generally try not to piss off too many people at the start until I get a feel for the lay of the board, so my general decision at start is really just Mos -> Ukr|StP .  Right now my default inclination is to go Ukr and try to get Rum, that may change as I talk to other players.  Happy to talk about trying to take that with fleet or army depending on how spring goes, and certainly not looking to commit to any particular long-term growth direction right now.  That being said, A/R is one of my favorite duos (R/F is up there too, but I don't think I've ever even seriously tried to pull that off in an online game - that's a FtF option where I know the players \ud83d\ude03 ).  \nI'm assuming standard Galicia bounce right now. happy to discuss other options.", "Yeah, I was figuring standard Galicia bounce too. Keeps both of us honest.", "So, here's my pitch: I have been on both sides of the deal when Austria, Italy, and Russia decide that everything would be simpler if there wasn't a Turkey. Every time, things have indeed been simpler for A/I/R. So, whaddya think? Wanna simplify our game?", "I literally just told Italy to go after Turkey first. \ud83d\ude00", "Oh, fwiw, I'd just as well neither of us tried for Galicia this turn, if you don't mind.", "Works fine for me.", "They free people of rumania depend on your good will. I assume he's going to force Black, so... That would actually leave him pretty exposed to you and Italy should you so desire.", "I certainly won't be helping him take Rum, so I think you can survive this.", "Well it looks like that worked great! I'm in a position to force Bulgaria, you're getting Sev back, and you'll be set to keep Rum. I'd appreciate it if you could support Greece to Bulgaria.", "Oh, I didn't reply yet, did I?  Yes, I can give that support.", "And if feel bad, except Turkey didn't even reach out to me even once last season to try and pitch something like blowing up my fleet to try and work together later on - just completely went radio silent after the setup", "Yeah, Turkey has not been handling this fantastically.", "I assume the Greece swap wasn't negotiated?", "No. No it was not. There are some heated discussions happening.", "What are you planning to do?", "Well, I was planning on finishing off \ud83e\udd83.  Tell me what you need.", "More specifically, I'm planning to take black. Other than that mostly looking to reposition North", "That works just fine for me.", "Italy's really angling to get me to attack you. I've put him off from expecting anything this season. FYI.", "Good to know.", "Welcome back to the land of open channels. Anyway, you know you and Italy don't have to fake fight on my account, right?", "The Tyrolia move is to slow down the west, I think.", "Sure, I more meant the Greece swap with attendant noise and the immediately swapping info on outside communications. \ud83d\ude00", "Heh. So, you taking Ankara?", "Planning on it. Then it's mostly a matter of seeing where England/France take their relationship.", "Yeah, they seems to have a bit of a clusterfuck going on. Should be fun to watch, at least \ud83d\ude1b", "Indeed. How do you feel about a good old fashioned bounce over Galicia?", "Sure, works for me.", "No need to confirm or deny, but I assume your deal with Italy is to convoy Greece to Smyrna.", "It's been discussed, not 100% sure if it's happening", "For my two cents, it's either that or you just take the second Turkish dot for yourself. I wouldn't want him growing with armies all up along the border.", "Italy is starting to be squirrely with me. Can we avoid the bounce in Galicia? I want to get that unit moving to Vienna.", "I didn't hear from you in time, so I left the bounce order in place. And I covered Serbia in case you got cute.

I think my most long term success comes from going after Italy, so I'm going to build an army in Trieste and let Italy go get engaged with France while I come after him.", "I'm building army Sebastopol for the obvious defense - assuming you do build in Trieste, will take steps to demilitarize that border (no move to Galicia or otherwise in your direction, cooperate on Smyrna, moving units away as soon as possible)", "Ball's in your court - I never really understood the strategy of lying on the builds, as there's little payoff to it generally, but we are where we are.  You're well-positioned to make a move either direction, I can only repeat that I'm really only set up to defend against you, and actually more interested in moving North", "That was less a lie, and more my having changed my plans to be in line with what I messaged you, but not being able to update my orders in time.", "Fair enough.  Either way, math remains the same.  If you want to move on me...well, y'all will win two dots eventually.  If you want to go the other way, you'll get two right away and I'll happily feck off to the North.

I'd assume you'd keep the ones around Budapest, but I can work with whatever you keep.", "I think I gotta keep Rum, Bul, and Ser, because they give the best chance of stopping Italy, and they're the ones in positions that you can't quickly get into.", "If you could support Rum-Bud, that'd be greatly appreciated.", "Absolutely.", "Can I cover Rum to keep that army on the front-line?", "Sure.", "Thanks.  Alright, Bud isn't guaranteed but it's as close as we can come - you have support, Tyr will be cut, and I'll cover the eastern flank", "Actually, I suppose I should say, it is guaranteed if you use Ser to support, but in the spring covering Tri may be just as useful.  Not my call!", "You know what?  Ignore the question about Rum - I have to cover Galicia anyway.", "What's your train of thought on the draw?", "I have it set - I set it right at the start of this turn, actually, and England and I both talked about it then.", "Seems to me like everyone is in, then. I've got it set, and set for early adjudication.", "So, did you veto the draw?", "Hell no. I want this torture to end.", "And I'm approaching from the point of view of assuming there's no artificial end date. As it turns out, doing this one extra turn is good for me, but in the long run my position isn't going to improve any.", "Oh - he can't take Serbia without losing Trieste, btw.  If serbia wanted to support Tyr -> Tri....it probably won't matter, but could in an edge case", "Good idea, so oedered.", "Er, ordered.", "GDI\nAll supports for bud to Serbia unless you have a better

Not happy with him. Us being good, well, that depends on what he builds.", "Yeah that will be interesting to see. That move actually makes me nervous about collaboration with France.

I'm likely opening north and I have my eye on Norway for the fall. However, this may be dependent on some discussion with France. Can I ask where you're planning to send your Moscow army this Spring?", "My initial inclination is to focus on the South.  I do have to weigh that over concerns of you opening full north, but hopefully we can stay on the same page.  I am of course much happier if you indicate you're going to put a fleet in Nwy.", "That's fair enough. I'm talking to France now about Belgium, as my army is pretty useless just hanging around the island. I can't commit to leaving my army off of Nwy just yet. Let me get back to you when I hear from France about Belgium.", "Sounds great.  Good luck in your French negotiations!", "Belgium definitely on the table but still not confirmed. Germany is acting like a big hot-head btw. Threatening war from the outset. If they don't calm down, maybe we can talk about helping you into Denmark next year.", "HI, I may be sending an army to Norway this fall, as it looks like France is trying to go to Belgium. However, I have no intention of going to St. Petersburg. I'd actually be more interested in Denmark, if you'd be willing to support that. This would be on the condition that I would help you into Berlin by cutting support in Kiel.", "No worries, mate - we're looking fine, so you do what you need to do \ud83d\ude03", "Alright, well we can chat about Denmark next year then.", "Hi, sorry to see the trouble with Turkey. Let's have a chat about St. Petersburg and Denmark.", "Shouldn't be too much worry \ud83d\ude0a\nI'm certainly not looking to start any issues with you. What are you thinking about Denmark?", "I don't know your thoughts on aggression against Germany at this juncture, but either of us could support the other into Denmark. This would likely cause a disband since I suspect Kiel will be occupied.", "I'm not necessarily opposed, as long as my other border gets priority attention \ud83d\ude03", "Ok, all things being equal, I'm not opposed to popping Denmark, especially if you use the move to back off one of those northern units.", "So, like vacate Norway? Or would you be on board with convoy army to denmark and then move NWG to Nwy?", "My preferred move would be Nth to Den, and Lon to Nth, but I understand if that seems a bit aggressive.", "I was thinking either nwy to den with nwg going to Norway, or the fleets in, filling North from Norwegian, but either way. I'll be driving for a couple hours, so you have a little time to think and let me know who the mover is.", "Back online - final decision on mover?", "I'm going for it in fall. Will you still be in Sweden?", "I will.  Will you still be in Norway?  If so, I'm inclined to order Swe -> Nwy just to build trust with Germany.", "Go for it.  I'll support hold from NWG just in case.", "Actually the support hold is unnecessary. Some reason I was thinking Denmark could theoretically support you in. I may do it anyways for kicks.", "I wasn't going to point out there was no possible support on Norway.  \ud83d\ude00", "Hi! Looks like it was a productive Spring for you. Are you still on board to support me into Denmark? I imagine that Germany will be looking for a friend in you.", "Yep. Just tell me the mover. I'd somewhat prefer it to be Norway, for obvious reasons", "Plan is to convoy norway army to denmark and move NWG to Norway.", "Sound good to you?", "Sounds great to me. Happy hunting!\nNext year I should be able to drop to Baltic if you want to keep pushing", "Great. I've entered my moves in. NWG to Nwy, Nwy to Den, NTH convoy Nwy to Den, HEL to Kie.

Shall we have a chat before our Spring moves?", "Indeed.", "So... Moving forward. How do you want to handle this?", "Well, what are your intentions on the German front this year?", "To be perfectly Frank, looks like my attention is needed to the South. The couple units up north can be flexible in their use.", "I'd be happy to repeat the same bounce we just did twice this year. Does that tie up units you'd like to send elsewhere?", "Nope, that's fine for this season.

Yeahh, you've left it pretty wide open in the north. What do I get out of showing restraint? Just a less powerful Austria?", "I have them stopped dead as long as you show restraint. \ud83d\ude00", "Well, you need to make sure Germany doesn't cut support in Sil, right?", "Also germany needs to not take that fleet to sweden", "True.", "I'm also thinking a bit long term for you. That next build probably comes from Germany. But you also need my help to get it. And I'm pretty friendly with germany right now.", "To be perfectly frank, I'm kinda happy being a stone wall for the moment. And make no mistake -there's potential for some fun fuckery on my part down south", "What's a scenario in which you get a build in the south?", "Rum?", "If they screw up, yes. More likely the count stays static but they have to keep scrambling and keep their units tied up there", "Should be fun!", "Looked like fun. I guess you won't be getting that build this year though.", "Oh, probably not -they'd have to really screw the pooch to let me build. But it is fun to keep them tied up.", "You can prevent a build though. Are you already planning this?", "Hey, just wanted to check in and see how things were going. I\u2019ve been enjoying our friendly north so far.", "Boring at the moment, but steady. Either Austria will realize his ass is hanging in the wind or Italy will get greedy, and either way the front opens up.", "Oh, gdi. Yes, I realize you need the build", "Yeah sorry to open the floor to discussion with a stab. I did need the build, and getting two was far from a guarantee for me (even though it turned out that way). I think we have a lot to discuss. How are you feeling about the state of the board?", "I'm kinda happy there's finally some movement, to be honest. And Austria's finally responding to messages after a two year silence. I think we're on a stop the leader phase which does have some opportunities for us, specifically", "I agree. Running through some tactics, I see that Italy can hold his western dots until he's forced to disband. I think we'll need to see two disbands, maybe three, before we can break through.", "Hi. Given that the beta test ends in 1909, wanted to check in about your goals (i.e. thoughts on a draw?)", "To be honest, I totally forgot about the end date.  I dunno - the only person who can even theoretically be removed by then is Austria, so we'll just see how that shakes out", "Yeah I think he said 1910 if we really wanted. But we are just the beta test. Italy austria and I have agreed on a 5-way draw. Germany wants to play out, but might be swayed if everyone else is on board.", "Ah, good point - I have the draw set now.", "Me too. Do you know how the draws get resolved? Germany is the last hold-out, and I think she's skeptical that she'll get duped somehow if she sets it as such. I thought it's just that play proceeds as normal unless everybody agrees to the same thing.", "That's correct - it will only pass if it's unanimous, or at least until everyone's draw setting is compatible.  For example, if four set it as four way draw, and one set as surrender, that's compatible with a four way draw excluding the surrendering power", "Reply all to Italy's message: First, if you didn't get a message from Italy claiming to have been sent to the whole board, please let me know. I'm down for the draw that he has proposed. I'd also like to add that I'll be checking the \"Adjudicate once all powers have issued orders\" box. If everyone does this maybe we don't have to wait until Sunday night to have this resolved! I'm not so confident as to issue a hold for all of my units, but will be submitting for the 5-way draw. Really enjoyed playing with you all, but I'm exhausted and ready to finish and see the stats.", "So I'm guessing it's italy holding out on the draw. I figure he proposed it to make the board lazy about collaboration, and he's secretly still trying to hit 18. Germany and I are collaborating to hold him off until the end.", "I concur", "And I'm trying like hell NOT to kill Austria in the process", "Good luck. Have you heard from Italy at all? He hasn\u2019t responded back to me", "Also, are you able to cut Tyr support to prevent Italy from getting to Mun?", "(not necessary, but would free up Ruh)", "Nope. Haven't heard a thing from him", "... Yes, that doesn't materially change the odds I lose Trieste.", "Ok, great. I think things should work out with me and germany holding down the fort.

England still strikes me as squirrelly - he says he's super-concerned about Germany, but I'm not sure I'm buying that.", "Thanks- that's great to hear and is confirming what I have been gathering. England is especially hard to read and I'm not sure I buy that either, but at least he's also telling me that he is worried about Germany.", "Looking good for you since you will be able to pick up Sweden. The lack of northern German prescence might mean a greater opportunity in Scandinavia for you.

I wonder if we can convince England to take Denmark? Perhaps by pointing out the threats in the south, and the need to prop you up.", "Just wanted to say that your moves this turn were really something. Well played!", "You as well. Looks like you have your territory well defended now.", "Yeah, for sure. Last season I was in panic mode, but it looks like the tables have turned with England choosing to fight Germany instead of team up with him.", "You're welcome on that one. \ud83d\ude00", "Haha- thank you! Didn't realize you were pulling strings behind the scenes, but I really appreciate you doing so.", "Hey, I needed him focused elsewhere than St Pete, and that was a direction I could help in", "\ud83d\udc4d", "I'm not sure what is happening in the West anymore. Some of it is due to the bot being down, but England's moves were pretty shocking to see. Any thoughts?", "Not strong ones. I feel like I need to cover my ass, but aside from that?", "Yeah, I feel that too. With England withdrawing I'm assuming you are no longer hitting Germany with your units, unless you have Italian help. If that is the case I might also stop aggravating Germany", "I am not pressing Germany this turn.", "Yeah, that turn went about as I expected.", "Should we throw to AI?", "Maybe?  I mean, I'm not opposed", "I am starting to get frustrated with England, who has not replied to my messages for over a year while clowning around instead of helping stop the Italy Austria alliance. What's stopping me from throwing is Germany asking me not to. And then she took Belgium, lol.", "Not sure what my game plan is here. Right now I'm working on getting Germany to build a fleet. My theory is that if Germany can pivot towards England then it may be a salvageable game. Eliminating England ASAP and there's a possibility we can end up in a draw once AI tensions build. But that is impossible if they see a weak north full of infighting that they can just roll over- then they have no reason to ever turn on eachother.", "Yep.  I have the south stopped cold at this point - and I told Austria after the Winter turn they would get two and then be stuck - but that means y'all gotta work your shit out and lock the other side, or this is an AI steamroll", "And if England starts nibbling from behind, this'll become the easiest throw ever"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true], "receiver_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, "NOANNOTATION", true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, "NOANNOTATION", "NOANNOTATION", true, true, true, true, true, true], "speakers": ["russia", "france", "russia", "france", "france", "russia", "france", "france", "russia", "france", "france", "russia", "france", "russia", "france", "russia", "france", "france", "russia", "france", "russia", "russia", "france", "russia", "france", "france", "russia", "russia"], "receivers": ["france", "russia", "france", "russia", "russia", "france", "russia", "russia", "france", "russia", "russia", "france", "russia", "france", "russia", "france", "russia", "russia", "france", "russia", "france", "france", "russia", "france", "russia", "russia", "france", "france"], "absolute_message_index": [12, 15, 36, 40, 141, 142, 149, 221, 233, 352, 455, 458, 464, 466, 469, 473, 477, 655, 660, 678, 694, 801, 907, 910, 1057, 1058, 1059, 1060], "relative_message_index": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], "seasons": ["Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Fall", "Fall", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Spring", "Fall", "Fall", "Fall", "Fall", "Fall", "Spring", "Fall", "Winter", "Winter", "Winter", "Winter"], "years": ["1901", "1901", "1901", "1901", "1901", "1901", "1901", "1901", "1901", "1902", "1902", "1902", "1902", "1902", "1902", "1902", "1902", "1903", "1903", "1903", "1903", "1903", "1904", "1904", "1904", "1904", "1904", "1904"], "game_score": ["4", "3", "4", "3", "3", "4", "3", "3", "4", "5", "5", "5", "5", "5", "5", "5", "5", "6", "6", "6", "6", "6", "6", "7", "5", "5", "5", "5"], "game_score_delta": ["1", "-1", "1", "-1", "-1", "1", "-1", "-1", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "0", "-1", "1", "0", "0", "0", "0"], "players": ["russia", "france"], "game_id": 1}

I agree, a DMZ is good for us both. I know that getting armies off of the island is pretty important for you. Depending on how it plays out we could talk about Belgium. Any thoughts on your other neighbors Germany and Russia?", "Cool, I'd like to then agree now to a DMZ in the channel through the end of 1902, and we can re-discuss that year about future plans. Are you on board? If so, will your fleet go to MAO?\n\nHaven't heard from Germany yet. I've been honest with Russia about going north, and Russia has expressed some concerns. Doesn't want me to bring my army to Nwy. So, Belgium may be a home I'm interested in if that's on the table.", "Wow Germany threatens war with me in the first message haha", "Yes, and yes. I will open to MAO. If Russia is adamantly against you putting an army in Norway, it might be worth it to not antagonize him provided that Russia and Germany are not working together. Belgium is definitely on the table", "Interesting haha, that is unusual", "Yeah, something tells me that player may be a little unpredictable. Sounds good on the agreement.\n\nFor Belgium, is there something you would want from me for you to give that up? Are you saying you may consider supporting me in? I don't think Germany will be thrilled about me being there.", "Yes, depending on how the spring plays out I may be in a position to support you into Belgium. I don't think it would be conditional on something you do, but rather if it makes sense given the positions in the Fall. Maybe building an army in London rather than a fleet, which likely compliments your goals anyway given the channel DMZ. I think you are right in that Germany would not want to see you in Belgium. If it will antagonize him anyway, it might make sense for us to launch a full out assault in the Fall (this would probably look like bouncing Holland to weaken the German position).", "All of that makes sense. Let's revisit before the fall orders then. I wouldn't be totally opposed to the idea of an attack on Germany, especially if he's not willing to engage in any meaningful discussion.", "FYI Germany has indicated he is taking his fleet to Holland in the Spring.", "Thanks for the heads up! That is an interesting choice, I think it may indicate a Russia/Germany agreement of some kind as it means Russia will be getting Sweden.", "Yeah, you may be right. Have you heard from Germany at all? Or Russia?", "I have, but nothing much. Seems like they are withholding information from me.", "Yeah I'm not getting much from them either. In a remote game it's hard to tell if people are being quiet on purpose or just not making themselves available on the chat. (This is my first time playing remote, so a bit of a different experience for me).", "Yeah, that is definitely one of the downsides of online diplomacy. By the way, we're still good with the channel, right? I know you must be anxious if Germany and Russia are not talking to you much, but I have to stress that this is not because I am working with them, and I am not moving to the channel.", "I am not going to the channel. We've agreed to keep out at least through the end of 1902, and I plan to uphold this. However, that message did make me a little nervous about your plans. Breaking an explicit agreement like that is cause for war in my book.", "That wasn't my intention at all and I am very glad that we are on the same page. Sorry if it came across like I don't trust you: I trust you which is why I hoped to bring up any potential worries before they happen. I could have worded it better \ud83d\ude05 .", "No worries. I did click the thumbs up on your message haha. Just wanted to be clear about the consequences of a stab.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Glad to see our commitment upheld. Seems like you may have your sights set on Belgium.", "Likewise! The rest of the map has been interesting. What's your read on the map? For me, I think that a supported attack on Belgium is likely the move given the spring turn.", "My read: Germany gets a pretty good start, facing only a bit of aggression from you.. Austria and Turkey are likely agreed to stand strong against Russia. However, I think there's a chance that Turkey is sort of overselling their \"opposition\" to Russia moving to Arm. There may be a juggernaut alliance in the works. Probably no real conflict between Austria and Italy. Maybe they'll bounce in Trieste. Austria has a pretty good start if he can secure Greece.", "Do you plan to take Belgium from Pic or Bur?", "This is all true. I think I will likely be taking it from Picardy, but I'm not sure yet.", "And here I thought Belgium was on the table. I guess it's already on your plate then? What's to stop me from working with the Germans to keep you out?", "Belgium IS on the table. But I didn't expect these spring moves, and with the way the map looks, I think you need to convince me that it would be worth it for me to be on 4 with you on 5. Totally different discussion if Italy is in Tyrolia, or if Germany bounced me out of Burgundy", "I'm looking at it from your point of view too, I think you have options other than Belgium, right? You could take Denmark for example.", "I can't take Denmark by force, and Germany isn't keen on letting me have it. The way I see it you'll easily take Portugal next year (assuming you go Spain s.c. with your fleet). And that line on Pic-Bur-Mar (assuming you build there) would make you really strong. Meanwhile I'm struggling to find a fifth supply center next year. Russia probably helps out germany with Denmark. So I'm looking at St. Petersburg at that point?", "What can you offer to balance this out if I let you in?", "I've had some time to think about it since the bot was down, and you are right about concerns over fairness. At the end of the day, the plan doesn't matter unless you are on board with it. If you are going to demand Belgium I'd rather support you in than bounce with you.", "If you can forgo Belgium this turn, we do have an opportunity to put you into Holland and/or Denmark next year, and that will quickly snowball into Scandinavia, Kiel, etc.", "You're suggesting I get a fleet in NTH and HEL? I think that's the only way to make that work. I would want no fleet built in Bre and our DMZ extended through at least the end of 1903. And probably one other country on board with the takedown. If we're stabbing Germany we should make sure she's taken out swiftly.", "I think that's the best way to do it, yeah. I agree to no fleet build in Brest and an extension to our DMZ to the end of 1903. The one thing I cannot guarantee is another country involved in the take down, but the best suspects would likely be Russia followed by Italy.", "Yeah, I was thinking Russia. This may be something to talk about next year, as we're running out of time here.", "Cool. I am happy to broach the subject when we are ready to. Especially if this turn goes well, he may be more inclined to help next year.", "Hmm what if germany bumps me in Nth or HEL?", "I was thinking this, and if you supported yourself into the North Sea through Norway you would just have to worry about being bounced out of Hel, which I think would be highly unlikely unless the plan is leaked. But the other option that is perhaps safer would be to move to Skaggerak, which Germany can't bounce", "I really don't think it's that unlikely. That Holland fleet has two places to go, and I expect it to move. Assuming a build in Kiel, Germany can bounce in Holland to block your entry. Also, I was planning to bring an army to Norway, so I wouldn't have the support to the North sea.", "This is too big a risk for me. My preferred move is to Belgium. I understand this may warrant doing a couple of favors for your next year in return. But I just feel too exposed otherwise. I'm about to head out for the evening and I have my move set for Belgium. I'm hoping for your support into there, but I understand if you can't provide it.", "Ok. What unit is moving to Belgium?", "The fleet", "Ok. And do you know what Germany will do with Holland this turn?", "Interesting", "Yeah, i actually botched my move because i forgot to click submit in the browser :/. Not that it would have made a difference. Hope you\u2019re enjoying Belgium.", "I didn't expect to get Belgium. I incorrectly inferred from all the information I had that Germany would support you into Belgium and tap Burgundy, so in order to not lose the support I decided to make Burgundy the mover.", "I mean. If anything, you are in a better position for not having moved there. I'm surprised it was a misorder. You've successfully put Germany and I into conflict and can pick off the remains.", "Another note. I would have put you into Belgium without hesitation if it was an army OR if I knew that Germany was not planning to support you in with Holland.", "Yeah i\u2019m not really buying that i\u2019m the big winner here, so you can save your breath. If you want an ally against germany, I\u2019d like to start hearing some ideas about what that relationship looks like.", "Not saying you are the big winner, I'm saying that your misorder was probably a good thing. Before we get into the details of an alliance against Germany, I think it's worth noting that the AI alliance is going to absolutely roll over Russia/Turkey, and so if you take Russia's dots that are easy to take, I think it will be helping Germany/Austria/Italy more than it helps you.", "I really think that we should get Russia on board, and it should be super easy to do. Just say that as long as Sweden helps you take Denmark, you won't take StP or Sweden for the time being. We could even put Russia into Denmark.", "I dunno if we actually have so much to work together on. If you build fleets and attack the coast, I'll be distracting all his armies. I need to devote all my resources to containing Germany's armies anyway. I think you guarantee Denmark next turn if we're clever about it.", "If Germany builds Fleet Kiel, we can support a convoy into Holland. But I think he'll be building armies- that's just intuition, I haven't been able to reach Germany and he's hard to talk to.", "Long term I think this looks like a Russia holding off Austria/Italy with Turkey being lepantoed, and then if we hit Germany hard with Russian help then we have a good shot of making it to the midgame and preventing AI from 2-way the board.", "Ok I'll respond over a few messages so I don't kill the bot.", "I agree Russia and Turkey are in trouble, but I think Russia is more vulnerable. I actually think it's possible that Turkey and Austria are friendly. Maybe the lepanto will be set up but won't come to fruition. If I were to add more pressure in the North, I think it's a really bad time for Russia overall. This gives me some leverage in negotiating with Russia.", "I agree on our limited opportunities for direct collaboration next year. However, I'd like to hear what your builds are going to be. A fleet in Brest would make me worried about you and Germany collaborating on an invasion.", "How is denmark a guarantee when Germany can support from Kiel?", "Ok I think that's all of my messages for now.", "It's possible, but I think Austria and Turkey are not friendly given the fact that Austria did not move Serbia to Rumania and Turkey tried to support that move. Russia is definitely still in trouble, though the target might be Turkey first.", "I have to build armies, no fleet in Brest.", "Denmark is a guarantee if you can get a fleet into Skaggerak and have Russia support you in. It then becomes a 3V2", "You could even do a clever tactic with Russia moving to Baltic, you moving to Sweden, and Skaggerak/north sea. Then it is a 4V2", "Ok so guarantee based on Russian collaboration. So you don't think Russia and Germany are friends anymore? I suppose they don't have many favors to offer one another", "Yeah I think that they are not working together but are simply coexisting", "I'm building a fleet in London. I hope that doesn't raise any alarms on your end. But if you were to build a fleet in Bre against your promise, any other build would leave me in bad shape. I know I'm being paranoid, but I'm more comfortable with that build", "Ok. I don't get why you think I'd build F Brest, but at the very least I appreciate the heads up. At some point I'd like to see you make a decisive move. So far it seems like you've been trying to make moves that both Germany and I agree to.", "You could break  DMZ in the channel and coordinate an invasion with Germany after building a fleet in Brest. By building in London I can do everything I might like to do eastward, and also i could respond better to a worst-case scenario.", "And what would have been my decisive move so far? A bump in Denmark? You were going to support me into Belgium so why would I have done that?", "Sometimes the less options you have the better off you are. A lot of diplomacy is signalling.", "I mean, my thinking process last turn was wondering why you didn't go to Denmark. My conclusion was that Germany was probably supporting you to Belgium. I'm just telling you the vibes I'm getting from you", "Germany \"was\" supporting me to Belgium and then didn't follow through", "That's really interesting haha", "Yeah so here I was thinking I had it in the bag. And then I first realized I flubbed my move and felt like an idiot. And then I looked closer and felt like an accidental genius.", "So back to signaling. You backed out of your, admittedly, vague and implied agreement to support me. What signal does that send to me? Are you saying that you're coming for me? That I can't totally trust you?", "Meanwhile, I've been totally honest with you for the sake of building trust and a good alliance. And you're going to complain about MY duplicity?", "So, I know this is a touchy subject, so I want to approach this delicately, but to be fair I was still deciding whether I would support you or not when you logged out for the night. I don't want to devolve this into \"what about when you did this thing that wasn't the best signal,\" but one of the things for me was considering why you weren't willing to move to Denmark. Sure, you want Belgium, but what does that mean for me when you want to put a fleet in Belgium and not an army? What is the follow-up play?", "I am not complaining about your duplicity. I'm complaining that we're missing opportunities to make strong progress because I think you aren't committed to working with me, but you aren't committed to working with Germany either. I think you would agree that had you worked with only Germany from the start, or worked with only me from the start, you'd be in a much better position, yeah?", "Yeah, that's all fair. The timing thing makes remote play kind of weird when there's a lapse in communication before an important move. We didn't really have a chance to talk about the fleet vs army there.", "But I don't get why you don't think I've been working with you. You proposed two possibilities: Belgium or Holland/Denmark in 1902. I expressed my preference after raising some concerns about Germany's ability to counter Holland/Denmark. You agreed to help me to Belgium.", "If you think commitment to a sole country is a good strategy, why haven't you followed it? Would you agree that I've been more committed to working with you than you have with me? That's pretty clear from your moves last turn.", "All great points- and I agree with you on a lot of this. I was very willing to support you to Belgium, but I should have made it more clear that it needed to be an army. I do believe commitment is a good strategy, which is what led me to some admittedly anti-German opening moves. I'm not saying you have not shown commitment, after all we have an excellent DMZ in the channel, but it does bug me a bit that I cannot identify something you have done to antagonize Germany.", "Well what would you like me to do to show this antagonism next year? Make the goal to secure denmark?", "Yes- I would very much love to see that. And the best part is that you get to see my super friendly builds before you decide on anything.", "Alright, this sounds good. Let's reconvene after builds then? That's Monday at noon right? It's probably time for me to get back to real life here haha.", "Sounds great, me too haha.", "Thoughts on builds?", "Yours were indeed friendly, which I appreciate. Germany's were what I expected. I thought Russia might have build in St. P, but I guess there's enough going on in the south to warrant the Warsaw build. The italian naples fleet is consistent with the lepanto, but then again what's the alternative build? Army in Rome? Also, I wonder if Austria-Italy are eyeing Munich this year.", "I have similar thoughts. I think that Russia and Turkey are both in a weak spot and all the evidence so far points towards them getting involved in a long and drawn out conflict. I'm sure Russia would have loved to build St Petersburg but couldn't afford to. Now, he is pretty much completely under your good graces. Austria and Italy may very well team up to take Munich.", "Germany's builds have come out to be very anti-French, so I am sure you are happy about those as well. It comes at the cost of cutting down the amount of options he has significantly. What do you think Germany might order?", "Trying to get a sense of the german plan now. I feel like germany has to play defense, unless they did something like Mun to Ruh to support into Bel or Bur to Gas to put pressure on Bre in the fall.", "Yeah, I do to. I was thinking that my best play might be to ignore Burgundy and hope it holds and instead go for something annoying like Holland or Ruhr, which would leave him to either withdraw to defend or leave himself prone in the North. Of course, it could backfire if he's thinking the same thing and ends up in Gascony.", "I'm trying to reason through how that plays out. Suppose germany supports Bur to Ruh with Bel. Then you can't penetrate right?", "Yes, if he moves Bur to Ruhr with support I can't get in. But it would also mean he's out of Burgundy, which is good for me and means if I retake Burgundy that I can start applying pressure to Ruhr and Munich", "If he moves Kiel to ruhr, he leaves all sorts of things completely exposed like Denmark. And if he leaves Munich he leaves that open as well", "Yeah, germany is in a tough spot. Any word from Italy in all this? I'm guessing the lepanto is the focus, but a move to either Pie or Tyr would be kind of taking a side.", "True. He said he was thinking about it, but not sure how much I can trust that. He'd certainly want to obscure moving to Piedmont if that is his plan.", "I know channel is tempting. If you think it might work, I'd totally support you to Holland, or I can tap Holland to make sure it can't leave by going to Helgoland without losing it. Moving to Helgoland or Skaggerak yourself can also be a strong play, especially if Germany thinks you are on his side. A move to skagg can be explained as a move on Russia and a move to Helgoland is deadly if it succeeds", "Pinging you since deadline is approaching", "whatever you decide, Don't break our DMZ in the channel. It's not worth it, I guarantee you that", "The DMZ stands. I'd like confirmation from you that it stays through the end of 1903.", "Confirmed.", "Hopefully that got to you on time \ud83d\ude2c", "Yeah, I'm here. I'm moving to Nth and Hel, holding in the others.", "I'd like one of Holland or Denmark this year. Both would be nice but maybe not feasible.", "Let's see Germany's Spring moves and restrategize.", "Sounds great!", "I will go to Ruhr then to apply some pressure there. Hopefully I'll make the right guesses when it comes to what Germany will do with burgundy. I believe that we can get you Denmark or Holland but it may require some clever manuevering in the fall.", "Are you self-bouncing in Gas to prevent the move there?", "That's a great option. I might change my moves to that actually. I have something more risky in mind at the moment though", "Nice, that worked out really well actually. Well done on taking the Helgoland Blight! That was a great call, and it means we can guarantee Holland for you next turn. Burgundy might retreat to Marseilles which is annoying, but manageable.  Or it could retreat to Munich. Very interesting that Russia made an aggressive move towards you.", "Nah, that was planned. Russia's trying to keep good graces with germany before helping me to denmark in the fall. I can't do this if I'm going for Holland though.", "I'm a little surprised austria and italy are totally staying out the fight. I guess they're really going for turkey.", "Even better! If Russia is helping you with Denmark I can apply some pressure on Ruhr, and cracking that key position means that on the next turn we start threatening home centers like Kiel and will be in excellent shape to tackle Holland on the next year. Depends how much you trust Russia- seems like he's been radio silent for me, but then again we don't have a lot to talk about.", "Yeah the moves in the east are pretty crazy actually. They are going hard against Turkey, and Russia made some excellent moves it looks like so Turkey is in a very tough spot.", "Agreed we're in good shape. Though I imagine after these moves germany will make a hard play for russian support. If I can indeed trust russia, I'll convoy an army from Norway to Denmark and cut support from Kiel with HEL.", "I wonder if there's anything to offer Russia to sweeten the deal?", "Great points. I think Russia may plan to further develop in the south, especially if he and Italy work something out against Austria, or if Austria and he work something out against Italy. If that's the case, he may just want the peace of mind that you are not going to attack him for a while. Otherwise, probably a German dot if he plans to play in the north.", "Looking back at the map, probably Berlin would be the best bet for a dot offer since Russia could take that with an army (after traveling to Prussia/Silesia from Warsaw) or with the fleet in Sweden (by traveling to the Baltic first).", "Yeah that's what I was thinking. Russia seems fine to support without it.", "Poor germany. She said she's a first-timer.", "Indeed. Though, I remember the people who I played with in my first few games were more than happy to introduce me to the game with some brutal stabs \ud83d\ude02", "Nice, that went well", "Sorry for the late notice. Just a heads up that I plan to build a fleet in Brest but will park it in the MAO as a deterrent to Italy", "Can you explain why you didn\u2019t build it in Mar?", "Yeah, sure. I couldn't build it in Marseilles because there would be very little I could tell Italy to persuade him that I wasn't planning to attack him with that build, even though that isn't my intention.", "What's the plan on the German front? Maybe we can get creative with the moves in a way that gets both of us at least one dot. I'm not holding myy breath on Ruhr, so I think the best play might be to send Belgium to Holland with support from the north sea while Denmark hits Kiel with support from Helgoland. If Germany makes similar moves to her last turn, we would pop both Kiel and Holland and would guarantee Munich/Berlin for next year. If Germany supports Kiel instead of moving to Ruhr, then we would guarantee Kiel in the fall as I'd walk into Ruhr and we would have Ruhr, Holland, Helgoland, and Denmark for a 4V3.", "Interesting to see you in the English Channel.", "So...", "You want to leave the channel? I can leave you alone so that you can do that.", "Not sure where all of this is coming from honesty. I know you feel bad for Germany since it's her first game, but for all you know she could just be lying about that for an advantage. If that's why you aren't talking to me, then I'd ask that you consider playing the board and not who you think everyone is.", "Based on the [redacted] profile, this is her second game on Backstabbr.

You're being stringed along and they will kill you as soon as they kill me. Their entire goal is to get us to fight. That's why Italy keeps trying to get me to go to the North Atlantic Ocean and why they constantly told me to take English Channel, which I ignored.", "Why do you want to kill me so badly?", "Whatever I did, I'm sorry.", "I can stop Italy this turn by the way. It's pretty easy since Italy let me into Marseilles, I can support the hold in Marseilles and Marseilles can support MAO to Spain SC. It's impossible to breach, I've checked it, and I can keep making those orders for years and years. You stabbed me in Spring 03. It is Fall 05. I think that you, Italy, and Germany are highly underestimating my ability to survive against your onslaught. You sure this is the game you want? Slowly whittling away at me until I die? Instead, I propose that we let you into the Mid Atlantic Ocean and that you help me defend Italy. I can send you past the MAO into West Med, where you can start taking dots like Tunis or Naples. We wait until AI crumbles, and you have an excellent game where you top the board.", "Hey. Want to talk?", "Old friend! Sure, why not?", "Awesome. I'm reaching out because we're entering the late game and I think Italy is making a push to solo. I think it may be time to take Sweden/St Petersburg and get Austria to turn on Italy", "I'm just one unit so I can't do much unfortunately, and likely will be soon eliminated. Maybe you can still turn the tides? I wonder how you feel about Italy after this last turn.", "Yeah it was a pretty brutal stab from italy. Would be happy to see him go down. Do you have thoughts on your remaining unit?", "I would be happy to use it however it would help", "Assuming that you and Germany are getting back together again", "My ask would be to attack Gas"],

Sure you have your reasons, just curious", "Yeah...Germany is telling me he thinks France and England are allies.  Would be bad.", "In all honesty, for the pressure.  I have no plans to lie to you, but if you happened to support Turkey into Greece or something, I would have options to respond in the fall", "Fair enough man.

He'll be busy for a while", "You told england to do that?  Or you told Germany to go after england?", "Also, when you can- whatrecyou thinking re: upcoming builds.", "I told both to attack each other.  Very truthfully of course.

I like Italy a lot, but I also like Turkey.", "Turkey is dead here.  Unfortunately it looks like England will grab up most of Russia's remains with this moveset", "What are you thinking this turn?", "Would you be open to supporting me into War?", "I need Gal to support myself in Rum.  You really need to be going after England here, I'm not sure why you've shifted east", "This is going to throw off the triple I've set up", "You still there?", "You're about to really hurt yourself.  England has nowhere to go now. Turkey is solidified, you and Italy will split France.  There is no option but for England to attack you", "You still playing?", "Yeah dude.", "I\u2019m thinking over what you said.", "I really want to make sure we don't screw up here.  I've been on your side all game.

No worries. That\u2019s my bad for not responding.

Can we confirm?", "No worries", "Confirm what exactly?", "That I don't hate you and vice versa :)", "That would be a good start", "Would love to talk about a takedown of England here though", "Yeah for sure", "Happy to listen \ud83d\ude03", "Can you get your units in position for takes of Norway and STP? That's two SCs for you and I can help you with Warsaw in the fall goes well and we adhere to our agreements", "Idk. I\u2019m not looking to expand past Warsaw and Paris this turn.

I can take two more SCs this turn without kicking over any logs.", "Except for me and England.  You're going to get too big for comfort, and the continuation of your working with England is a threat to me", "You're already making the both of us nervous, and you wouldn't want to push it", "I prefer to stay neutral between the two of you, and Italy for that matter.", "Right, but it's about how people percieve you.  You can take all the neutral centers you want, but the larger you are, the bigger the threat you are. England and Italy and I feel the pressure already.  I don't have a problem with you yet, but you need to turn on England here, as the chance of you two working together will require both Italy and I to stop what we're doing and respond to the threat you two pose", "I'm trying to share this in your best interest", "If I\u2019m not mistaken, we have the same number of units?", "I don\u2019t tell you to lay off Turkey.", "Or to go after Italy", "You're in a better position right now.", "And you have free available centers- two center jump", "And no true enemies for this one turn", "All those add up to make you far more dangerous.  It's not just about SC counts", "That\u2019s true. I\u2019m trying to keep it that way (no enemies).", "I really do appreciate you being honest with me.", "Right, but you'll go from 0 to 3 if you misplay this one.  This is critical. I really want to see you succeed here and our central triple to remain intact. I've put a lot of work into this one", "I suggest managing your front so you have just one enemy in front of you, rather than 3 on all sides", ":) I'm glad", "Is there a way you can be comfortable a move set that doesn\u2019t involve turning in England? He got spoked that I accidentally went into Ska.", "He needs to be spooked.  Where do you think that army in LVP is going this turn?", "In Edinburgh?", "It's not going south", "Right it\u2019s going Norway", "It's convoying across to Norway, and after that either through Scandinavia or into Russia. Warsaw will be the first SC he takes back", "That army is a recognition of the threat you pose. Please please please realize that", "While you're being nice to him, he's planning his attack", "You think he\u2019ll turn on me?", "That army can go nowhere but against your border", "It would be one thing if he was moving on a defenseless France", "But it's not, he's headed North", "That's your domain. You need to start defending and thinking long term", "I\u2019m going to remain neutral this turn but I will revisit in the fall based on how my neighbors move.", "Jesus.  I'm already moving against England this turn.  This is so frustrating to me. I'm trying to help you out and you're going to start hurting the both of us", "Look at the board and see the moves being set up", "He will have his front against you far before you'll be able to react to it", "I hope that does not imply and bad blood between us, I just have to be up early tomorrow. If he moves against me or does something looking suspicious I\u2019ll revisit it tomorrow.", "Well, I'm clearly wrong about England, but I still think it's the wrong moveset", "You still there?", "Yes, hey!", "Should we make the 10 pm chat a regular thing? \ud83d\ude02", "Hahahah", "Little late for me, ready for bed", "I'm in bed. The last chat killed me last night lol", "But I felt too strongly to let it go rip", "Lol no worries- what\u2019s going on tn? I don\u2019t have any interesting moves set, just defense", "I hate to sound like a broken record, but you can take Norway here with literally no repercussions", "Btw rumour has it that you\u2019re a nationally ranked player... is that so?", "Do you know what England is doing with Moscow?", "But that's your call", "Not interested, sorry.", "Not for certain, no.", "Don't trust water cooler talk :)", "Is that a no?", "I've played a lot of Diplomacy and run a top Diplomacy site.  I'm sure there are better players than me out there", "Makes sense!", "In a perfect world, you would talk Moscow at no cost to yourself, just to cut a potential support", "Can you find out what's going on with Moscow? I would really not like him to hit Sev", "I can ask. I sent eng a couple messages in the last hour and haven\u2019t heard back :/", "I have too.  Would you be open to tapping Moscow for me if you don't hear back?", "Because I'm not hearing back from England, I may take Moscow here so I don't lose a center to Turkey.  Hopefully this gives you the ammunition you need to go after England yourself", "Thoughts for this turn?", "I think you can win or lose on this one right here", "How\u2019s that?", "Not sure how long we're playing or if you're looking at stalemate lines, but you're pretty damn close to the NS stalemate line and the board lead", "Too close for comfort \u2764", "\ud83d\ude09", "So what are you saying?", "I'm not telling you how to win \ud83d\ude02", "I don\u2019t see how I am going to win? I\u2019m in the center of the board. You are almost as strong as me, and will be stronger once you destroy turkey.", "Turkey isn't going down any time soon, even slower if the two of us can't work something out tonight and I have to move back up nothing", "Also, you've discovered the golden Diplomacy trick, just insist you're not strong and hope others believe you", "What would it look like for us to work something out?", "back up north*", "It depends.  Your builds aren't particularly friendly towards me or England, and I think he's finally spooked", "I don\u2019t blame him.", "So we can start with that.  What is your intention with the two army builds?", "I\u2019ll be honest it\u2019s not madly thought through", "I can\u2019t go north", "I can\u2019t go anywhere", "All I can do is scare the pants off everyone", "You managed \ud83d\ude02", "I've been in conversations all day", "Anything interesting?", "Mostly England asking me to pull off Turkey and move North against you", "THat was the most substantive", "Is that true? I\u2019m not sure if I believe that. Are you baiting me into attacking England?", "I can't share screenshots apparently, but that's true.  It's not just ENgland", "You and I are the big players here, and Italy asked me to do the same", "So why don't we, as the big players, take control of ourselves", "and run the board the way we want, without the undue influence of the other players", "I mean... I could be interested but I need some clarity", "I\u2019m weary. Frankly I understand you are a very gifted player and I\u2019m nervous about my odds of winning a one on one versus you.", "I've been talking a lot and have a vision of the board that you don't seem to buy into.  Why don't you start with sharing your perfect setup.  Obviously it's a win, but where do you pick up your centers?  We don't have to be at odds here.  If I win, it's because I take out Germany and Italy.  What is your ideal scenario?", "I'm gifted because I spend time on conversations like this.  Most players don't.  The moveset of Diplomacy is pretty simple.  Akin to checkers.  I'm terrible at the Cold War 1v1 varient \ud83d\ude04 ;D", "Hmmm", "You\u2019re also a verrrrrry smooth talker", "For all I know you\u2019ve already set up a massive plan to attack me", "Hey man, I\u2019m gonna be away from my phone for 30 min", "You far overestimate me [redacted] lol", "Who is this?!", "hmmm ok.  Moves process in less than two hours", "Wait a second", "Woah", "You just dropped a big thing there", "The point is, you can trust me", "NO I CANT?!?? I have no idea who you are lol", "And you know who I am", "That\u2019s like literally the opposite of trust lol", "Faith then", "Idk anyone who lives in Maine or works at Hudson", "This is legit creepy not gonna lie", "*worked at Hudson whatever", "This is having the opposite effect", "I didn't work there, I was an intern", "The point is that we need to work something out asap.", "Yes definitely", "I mean if I knew who you were then I would feel much more comfortable and far more likely to work something out", "You talked it Italy", "you talked to Italy lol", "Yeah dude I\u2019m so freaked out rn", "That's what Italy just said lol", "Idk who else to talk to this is like actually freaking me out", "Like irl", "Like I\u2019m really freaked", "Dear God.", "This is kinda distracting.  You'll find out who I am after the game", "Dude but you know who I am RN", "like wtf", "How long have you played Diplomacy?", "Definitely not used to being like doxed online lol", "I mean like I\u2019ve mostly played gunboat so I\u2019m not used to the this dynamic", "I hope you are like a buddy of mine IRL so we can laugh about this in a week but rn I\u2019m just like WTF", "You're not being doxed, you don't have to worry", "It\u2019s like okay dude but it doesn\u2019t feel chill to me that you have a face to a country and I don\u2019t", "Do you actually know me IRL or did you just like figure out who I was through tracing an email address or something?", "This is kind of a waste of our time.  We can laugh this off when the game is over", "goddammit", "Idk man it\u2019s just like", "Kinda Erie from my POV", "who knows I might not like you IRL", "Lmfao", "Or you could be a close buddy idk", "But either way", "I HATE the dynamic of you knowing who I am IRL and me being in the dark", "You'll know my real name and all kinds of shit about me later, let's play the game right now", "Yeah dude I\u2019m sorry but that gambit really backfired", "I want to work with you here, let's start with that as a building block", "not it didn't", "It fundamentally creates an uneven and uneasy dynamic between me and you.", "I DO NOT feel comfy with it.", "I know", "This has happened to me before", "Sorry. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a great dude but I don\u2019t like this. It definitely did not create trust, just totally broke it.", "How long have you known? How did you know? Who are you irl?", "Now these thoughts will supersede any thing you say", "Sorry", "We didn't have trust before.  You thought we had trust.  This is foundational to the mirage of Diplomacy", "And now you understand", "When you call me a good player or a smooth talker, you know nothing about me or my gameplay style", "So now that we've broken the pieces, we start from the beginning", "I have to run now.  This was a very frustrating end to a good day", "Sorry man but you brought this on yourself", "I'm a little surprised you're surprised.  You put your name publicly on discord and shared what you do for work and where you are on any given weekend", "I could have found out your name in three different ways", "Hopefully we\u2019ll laugh about this in the future", "Not nearly as creepy as the guy that looked me up on facebook and knows my girlfriend's name", "ok", "Someone in this current game?", "No", "Nobody has the capacity nor cares enough to dox you man", "Sorry bro, you made a calculation and you were wrong.", "I don't believe I am now", "Maybe this was all part of your plan. Idk, idc.", "You\u2019re really smart and whatever idc", "I needed to flip your mindset a little bit", "But I didn't plan for you to be this freaked out", "So I do apologize for that", "It\u2019s cool. You must not know me that well IRL", "Diplomacy is all about trust.  The beauty about it is that you can't trust anyone.  All anyone can do is spin a web and make assumptions about people.  You were trying to do that to me earlier, it seems, without realizing it", "Did you request it?", "Nope just as surprised as you are", "Wonder if England did", "Possibly", "Are you moving south here?", "Any final thoughts?", "Got to finalize some plans myself, just checking in", "I can support you into Rum here if you want.  I'm holding my northern line so don't bother taking it out.  However it may benefit you to move against T here", "You there?", "Yeah", "thoughts?", "I\u2019m not interested man.

Are you taking Ruhr or Burgundy?", "Ruhr and Hol probably", "But I\u2019m not 100% sure", "I might move Mun to Ber to protect from Russia", "Hey there. What do you think about pushing further into France with me and Italy?", "Hey! I\u2019m open to it. What are your thoughts on Sweden?", "Russia is asking me to support him into Sweden. I\u2019d prefer if you just continue to bounce him out. So I can grab St. Pete. Then you can have Sweden.", "Sound like a plan?", "Hello", "Hi, there", "Was that a friendly hello before the stab? Did you have something you wanted to discuss?", "Yeah I mean I hadn\u2019t really heard from you so wanted to reach out.", "I would like to work something out with you. We both have a common rival in France at the moment.", "The last message before your hello was me asking you to help me against Russia. I hadn\u2019t really heard from you. Not the other way around. Did you not receive that message? We should talk to the admins if so", "Would you be willing to support me into Paris?", "Yes and I responded. Did you get my response?", "I did not", "Hmm. Maybe it was when things were glitchy?", "I\u2019ll message the admin. Well what did you say?", "I would screen shot but I feel like that\u2019s against the rules of the study", "\u201cHe\u2019s asking for my support too. I\u2019m not committal. I\u2019m open to it because  he didn\u2019t screw me in Ber last year.\u201d", "That\u2019s why I stayed out of it", "Ok, let\u2019s turn this partnership around.", "Russia is a goner.  Austria is the next biggest threat once we deal with France.", "Can I count on your support into Paris?", "No I have the unit committed to supporting Italy", "Ah, ok. I\u2019d like to avoid losing a dot if possible. Looking unlikely I guess.", "Well, that\u2019s not true.", "Maybe if I manage to hold Norway.", "You should grab Sweden.", "Just making sure you got my messages.", "Yes sorry", "I\u2019m taking to Italy about how we split up France.", "Any suggestions?", "See I don\u2019t know what I can realistically get out of that scenario.", "Well you already have Belgium and Holland. Paris is all yours.  Italy can have marseille and Spain and I can take Brest and Portugal. What do you think of that? Then we all head east to face Austria and turkey.", "That is if Austria doesn\u2019t stab Italy first", "And you don\u2019t stab me", "You heading east goes right through me tho.", "No, I plan on going through Russia. I want to land in Scandinavia and move from there.", "I need an ally near me. Russia is obviously out. The only other option at this stage is France or you. France has been very uncommunicative so I\u2019d like it to be you.", "I feel the same way.", "I have one additional term. I need control of the North Sea. If I have the North Sea, I can move my units  in Denmark Holland and Belgium away to focus on supporting other offences. I can\u2019t risk being knifed in the back and cannot keep three units defending against the North Sea to feel safe.", "I\u2019ve heard that Austria is one of the top ranked players in the world. Did you know this?", "I didn\u2019t know that.", "I can\u2019t leave the North Sea open for two reasons. The first is the same concern as yours. The second is I\u2019ll need it to convoy troops.", "Could you convoy through the channel? You would have my support. and I don\u2019t mean open, I mean mine.", "I guess I could convoy via Norwegian Sea but I still have the same concerns that you do except they\u2019re my home centers!", "1. I don\u2019t blame you for a second", "You are also in a very strong position with 2 fleets in the north.", "2. I\u2019m attracted to this alliance because I do not want Austria to win. It would be so lame if we all lose to the top guy.", "It can work but we just need to keep each other in check.", "Yeah. If one of us gets too weak it becomes tempting. England- Germany alliance are very difficult.", "Austria is going to get two builds. It\u2019s unlikely peace can hold in the east.", "With you in the North Sea, I feel like I can\u2019t leave Denmark or Holland undefended. But I understand with me there you will feel the same about Edinburough and London.", "Do you know if Italy is going to try and take Smyrna?", "I don\u2019t.", "You\u2019re correct. While it would be nice to be able to move those units east. Let\u2019s try and make it work with you staying there.", "I\u2019m not on board with that. I can just have two units sitting around doing nothing just to be your pal, no offense.", "So we let Austria roll?", "Because it will be a grind between us while Austria gains momentum", "Yeah but sometimes you have to take those kinds of risks.", "What about a demilitarised North Sea. We agree to leave it open.", "I\u2019m way more amenable to that", "That way, I think we both get what we want.", "Which is basically trust but verify.", "But starting next season? I need to convoy into Norway this season.", "Will you be taking Sweden?", "Kinda depends on what we finalise here", "I mean I can. Russia knows he\u2019s done, that would just be a final nail in the coffin.", "Ok, I\u2019ll be convoying into Norway this season. Next season I move into Norwegian Sea or channel depending on frances moves.", "Do you think Italy can be pealed away from Austria?", "That\u2019s gonna be a question we\u2019ll have to face later. I have no idea now.", "All Italy cares about is France right now. No clue what his future plans hold.", "Makes sense. He\u2019s a good player. How long do you see these terms holding out? Does Paris still go to me?", "This strategy leaves me little room to build outside of heading east, which is my concern.", "Yes you still get Paris", "I\u2019m not really sure. I hope we can can see this to the end.", "Ok", "For the record", "I talked to Austria", "And he was trying to talk me into attacking you", "Taking the North Sea right now", "Basically just knifing you while I \u201chave the upper hand\u201d", "He\u2019s talking to me to about going after you", "No shit", "What\u2019s he saying?", "Lol", "So that\u2019s why I feel like we need to make this deal.", "But perhaps we can be even more clever.", "He\u2019s saying that I need to work with France to make sure you don\u2019t get too strong", "How can we be more clever?", "Basically we have to agree on a strong alliance first", "Before we can start playing 4d chess", "Italy is a nice guy, but as far as I see he is going to be an Austria puppet.", "You know I\u2019m all in on it", "I agree", "Hell yeah", "I think a simple move is to string Austria along as long as possible, without raising suspicions of an Anglo-German alliance.", "This way we can get as much intel we can", "I think I can say I took sweden instead of the North Sea because I wanted another build, maybe he\u2019ll think I\u2019m a noob, I don\u2019t know any better, and will only be moderately suspicious", "But how do I know you\u2019re actually in and not just playing me?", "Hello? I\u2019m already nervous you\u2019re like reporting all this to Austria haha", "Sorry", "I\u2019m FaceTiming with my gf and she gets kissed when I click over to discord", "We are 100% on", "HAHAHAH dude I\u2019m about to ft my gf too.", "So you understand", "Okay. I\u2019m going to trust you. A ~radical~ thing to do in this game.", "Of course bro.", "Let\u2019s take down Austria. I\u2019m gonna tell Italy that we are iffy and have some trouble in case he\u2019s reporting to Austria", "Basically just to be clear, I see this as a long term alliance to stop Austria. From my POV, it\u2019s not about me or you winning ourselves but about having someone other than this top ranked player beat all of us.", "Hell yeah.", "100%", "Also honestly this will be more fun if you\u2019re working together like total hand in glove with someone", "Plus think about the diplomatic advantage of us being able to triangulate intel", "Good looks with Italy", "Hey man what\u2019s going on with your supporting order into bur.", "Complete oversight. I had my orders like that before we came to our agreement. Between talking to you and Italy and Austria AND my gf last night I forgot to change them up. My bad.", "That\u2019s why there was a useless support of North Sea as well", "I should have moved London to the channel", "Okay no worries at all. I\u2019ll take your word for it totally, but it kinda put me on alert that\u2019s all.", "And yeah like 45 minutes before the turn ended I still had my dudes invading Norway lol so no sweat.", "Basically no harm done, but like if you do fuck me, instead of my mission being kill Austria it\u2019s gonna change to you lol", "Def don\u2019t wasn\u2019t that tho", "*want", "Absolutely. I\u2019m still team kill Austria (and maybe Italy)", "I\u2019d love to peak Italy away from Austria but there\u2019s only so much we can do", "*peal", "I\u2019m gonna be super busy tomorrow so down to tan through some moves now. I would love to pick up Warsaw and Paris this turn, so I can have the strength to blitzkrieg into Austria", "Gonna need your help with nonaggression in the North Sea. Can you move your fleet to the Norwegian Sea next turn?", "There\u2019s definitely going to be a target on my back", "Any interest in supporting me into Paris", "I\u2019m about to take off for a flight and probably won\u2019t land before adjudication. I\u2019ll support you into laris and move from the North Sea but I need builds.", "Clutch thanks!", "I can help where needed", "Actually I can\u2019t support", "I need that to move on Brest", "But I will move from North Sea", "I\u2019ll support you in next season", "Taking off. God speed.", "Hmm. Maybe don\u2019t move North Sea. Might spoke Austria and Italy", "This is gonna be awesome", "Oh shit", "Do you think France will retreat to the North Sea if you take the channel???", "That could fuck up everything", "Additionally, IF and only IF you feel comfortable with it, I\u2019m happy to move my fleet into position to help you with the battle of the channel and to try to rout France from slipping into the Irish Sea or worse the Norwegian Sea. Russia is going to lose that fleet next turn I\u2019m assuming so I literally won\u2019t have anything to do with my two fleets. If prefer to use them to help you in the west and to potentially convoy your units as needed.", "I would also talk to Turkey about what is going to happen in Moscow.", "Damn I wish we could call people rather than text but hey whatever", "It\u2019s going to be hard to pull Italy away from Austria. We have to really strategize how we pull the ultimate stab. We should gently work on loosening Italy from Austria, but be prepared in case that doesn\u2019t happen.", "Also no worries at all if not, but if you could support me into Paris that would be dope. No worries if you can\u2019t at all!", "Let me know if you\u2019re cool with me temporarily putting my fleet in ska in the North Sea to block off France. France retreating their will screw things up big time. I have it set to move there right now, but I\u2019ll call it off immediately if you tell me to.", "Yeah, I\u2019m pretty uncomfortable with you in the North Sea.", "Let me think for a sec", "We can bounce North Sea.", "I\u2019m game. That serves the same end", "It means I don\u2019t force channel though", "Right that was my thought too.", "I guess it just has to be that way.", "Can you move ska to bal?", "I mean den", "Ska was gonna bounce the North Sea", "Yeah, I\u2019m dumb", "Did you work out Warsaw with Austria?", "I mean he\u2019s not protesting me going after it but in all likelihood I won\u2019t get it till spring", "We kinda need to make a big play in spring 1905 before Turkey is totally destroyed", "Will he support you in?", "Turkey is supporting me into Moscow in exchange for support in sev.", "Why did you move to ska?", "All that does is threaten Norway needlessly", "Accidental move", "I mean to go bal, but it\u2019s kinda inconsequential to me. I really don\u2019t have anything for those guys to do.", "Except threaten me", "But yeah I don\u2019t blame you for feeling suspicious", "Yeah dude really total oversight. I\u2019m committed to this alliance.", "How can you rectify it?", "If you\u2019re scared I\u2019m happy to set something you like as good faith but I think I\u2019ve been pretty accurate to my word", "Gez man", "Whatever you want I literally have nothing to do with these units", "I get it tho I felt the same last turn but like I don\u2019t want these kinda things to totally throw us off. I\u2019m  banking on you help stop Austria and definitely have placed my trust in you", "12 hours days", "I\u2019m at a conference for work and can\u2019t really pay too much attention to this rn", "But like in sort", "I\u2019ll do what you want", "But I don\u2019t like this tone of \u201chow will you rectify\u201d like I don\u2019t want any tension here", "Ok, fair enough. I had one of those days too. It\u2019s a suspicious move but as long as we can figure out a way to get you back in Denmark we\u2019re cool.", "I\u2019m totally game.", "And like I said, no hard feelings here either. I think we\u2019ve both really committed to working together and so we\u2019re hypersensitive to getting stabbed", "Here\u2019s my orders as they are set right now.\nBur>Par\nHold in Bel\nKie>Ruh\nBer>Pru\nSil>War\nSka>Den\nHold Sweden", "Honestly it might be best to make a habit out of sharing and confirming our movesets to avoid problems like this. That way if there is a stab, there are no two ways about it.", "Another thought - maybe, we agree that if we want to break the alliance after Austria is subdued we have a one term armistice so we can regroup and prepare, once again to reduce risk of stab", "F BAR - NWG\nF Lon - NTH\nA Pic - Bre\nA Stp - Mos\nF Wal H", "Building an army in Edi so I can convoy to Norway. Going to push on the channel from North Sea.", "If Russia is smart, he\u2019ll disband Warsaw because it\u2019s dead no matter what. That will be annoying for st. Pete but we\u2019ll see.", "Austria is nervous of you. He\u2019s asking me to not support you into Warsaw. I\u2019m playing very coy. Happy to support you in but if you think we can use this for some duplicity why it try? I could tell him I\u2019ll help him out to keep him on my side for now. He sees that you will be \u201cpointlessly moving east.\u201d And you are a \u201cpoor player who doesn\u2019t deserve Warsaw.\u201d Clearly some threat there.", "HAHAHAH now I really want him dead", "Like why a dick? Does he think that we want his respect because he\u2019s some highly ranked dude? BS. As long as he loses, I\u2019m happy.", "*what", "He messaged me that he\u2019s confused why I won\u2019t move on england", "He just messaged me asking me to \u201ctalk tonight.\u201d", "Whatever that means.", "I hope we can troll him good", "Good to know. Me too!", "Austria is trying to convince me that you will attack me lol", "He\u2019s committed to joining forces against you. I\u2019ve stayed silent.", "Thanks man.", "Could you support me into Paris? Once I\u2019m there I can support you on the coast.", "Sure", "Thanks man! Much appreciated. How did your chat go with Austria?", "Hey man how\u2019s it going?", "Austria is telling me things you apparently said about me", "Trying to provoke me to attack you.", "I haven\u2019t said a word to him", "Keeping him in the dark", "Smooth.", "Ok, now he\u2019s trying to convince me that the only place for expansion is through you. Are you not planning on moving on him? I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t move into Munich.", "I\u2019m moving on him in the spring after I get my two new builds. I don\u2019t want to arouse too much suspicion before the blitzkrieg", "So the plan is army in Munich and army in Berlin? Will you support pic into Brest?", "Yes, I\u2019ve already set my orders to do so.", "And yes army in Mun and Ber", "Still wanna share orders?", "Yeah for sure. Especially if we\u2019re going to turn on Austria soon, we should be coordinating clearly", "Have you been talking to Italy or Turkey?", "I\u2019ve been talking to turkey but he realizes he\u2019s donezo", "Don\u2019t be tempted by Austria. He\u2019s a smooooth talker.", "F ENG S NAO - MAO\nA Mos S Arm - Sev\nF NAO - MAO\nA Pic - Bre\nF Wal S Yor - Lon\nA Yor - Lon", "He sure is.

Also, we should block frances retreat in the North Sea.", "I was supporting Armenia to sev", "Nice. I think we should protect the north seas because a rouge french fleet will be a big distraction from the Austria front.", "Updated my orders. I\u2019m now supporting you in Moscow.", "Italy is telling me that you and Austria will team against me in Warsaw. I think this is Austria trying to bait me into acting against you or him.", "I\u2019m going to bounce France out of the North Sea baring protest from you. I will remove my fleet from the North Sea once it is not needed to protect from France.", "That\u2019s cool with me. We have to stay strong. I won\u2019t be flipping", "A Bel - Ruh\nA Bur S Par\nF Den - NTH\nA Par S Pic - Bre\nA Sil S War\nF Swe - Den\nA War S Mos", "My updated orders", "I need some strategy help", "I needed to convince Austria not to take Moscow. In told him I wouldn\u2019t support turkey into sev if he didn\u2019t take Moscow and then we could talk about moving against you. The truth is I still plan on supporting turkey however I don\u2019t have much of a plan after that. We need more armies up north.", "I just realized that for that to work, Warsaw needs to hit Ukraine", "Is that possible?", "Geez, so many moving parts here.", "If I don\u2019t hear from you 5 minutes before adjudication I\u2019ll just hold Moscow and deal with turkey and sev next year.", "Hey just got out of a meeting", "Glad to hear from you", "My fear is that by hitting Ukraine, I provoke Austria and become the aggressor. That makes it unlikely we can convince Italy to stay neutral. At this point, I am almost hoping Austria attacks me in some way so I can claim retaliation and blitzkrieg", "Just read my message from Austria, he is thinking about taking Moscow.", "He said \u201cbecause I am not hearing from england...\u201d this was 9:05 am est so I assumed you have hammered it out since then.", "*assume", "Unless he stabs, yes", "Sweet. IF he does stab, then we have an excuse to invade.", "I\u2019m not going to try and convince you to move against Austria if you don\u2019t want to. I do think however that if we can knock him out of sev we are on a much better strategic position. I\u2019ll plan on holding Moscow unless you say otherwise.", "What can I do to knock him out of Sev on this turn?", "I totally agree. There is nothing I rather do than deny him another build.", "But I don\u2019t see how I can possibly stop him this turn. I had the same conversation with Turkey.", "You hit Ukraine. I support Armenia into sev. Black supports Armenia", "Damn this is a tough call.", "Well you let me know what you want to do and I\u2019ll plan around it. It\u2019s all up to you.", "Maybe it\u2019s time to just go ahead and make the first strike. I alert him to my intentions, but deny him a build, which is far more important.", "Still, the trade off is now he will be able to move against me in spring 1905 and that might be a big advantage.", "But your builds will protect against that, no? Don\u2019t forget that by doing this turkey is still a contender", "So with this move, his army in sev is forced to disband", "Right", "So do I hold or support?", "If I hit Austria, what does our spring 1905 strategy look like?", "I\u2019m playing around with the sandbox.", "Our odds are better if Italy stays out of it. If we go all out on Austria, we need you and turkey to be strong. It\u2019s going to be intense in no mans land and everything will come down to who\u2019s line breaks first.", "We\u2019ll have Austria squished.", "Either I build armies and funnel through Scandinavia to help you or build fleets and take on Italy.", "I\u2019m nervous but I think it\u2019s time to take the plunge. This is minus one for Austria and plus one for our ally.", "Ok, cool.

I\u2019m sure that would have happened any way but we destroy any possibility. \n2. We give Austria a heads up, he will defending the neutral ground", "Yeah actually", "We can\u2019t do it this turn, I\u2019m sorry. Once I get the jump on him in the spring I can force him to disband.

Hold Moscow it is.", "I\u2019m too risk adverse", "Wow, good call my man. Turkey is dumb. Shame I couldn\u2019t take Brest.", "We avoided prematurely springing ww3 by the skin of our teeth", "We should get thinking about what the next move is. We\u2019re lucky that we have the build phase now so we have 36 hours to brainstorm the best move and gather more intel.  \n\nI would love to work out a scenario where Italy remains neutral but assuming that won\u2019t happen, I think you\u2019ll have to be prepared to keep him busy in the west cleaning up the ruins of France.", "Perhaps I can convoy your army in London to Norway and you can begin to sweep him in?", "I was thinking the same thing re:convoying to Norway. I need to find a couple builds. Brest is a lock. And I\u2019ll have to make sure Italy is still on board with giving me Portugal. I\u2019d like to see more of my fleets pushing into the med and more of your armies pushing east. I don\u2019t have time to think about precise moves but just general strategy", "Yes I agree.

The longer I wait the stronger Austria grows while I stagnate.", "I\u2019m in the same boat my man. Austria is the only way for you to expand other than through me.

Very chatty", "They seem like nice guys. Very chatty", "Right I agree. Russia seems to be going after me.", "Why did the army in Pru halt?", "Also, it's clear that Austria is going to build 2 units in Tri and Vie.

I\u2019m more focused on France and England at the moment", "Okay, good luck with that. I think Russia will move back for now so that'll hopefully be helpful int the short term", "Looks like Russia is finished... Any plans for the future? I'm not sure how long I can hold out here", "I\u2019m still deciding what to do in Scandinavia", "Well, if Austria grabs warsaw, Russia will probably disband that fleet", "So just take Sweden?", "Yeah, or you F Den S F Ska - Swe", "Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t mind keeping Russia alive on life support", "Or the same for norway.

It risks an Austria win, but could allow me rapid growth, especially if I take Norway and then the North Sea next turn.", "Yeah, though I'm inclined to think he will move his fleet to norway since it's fall. But in effect he will be giving up the channel, allowing france to move his troops", "Either way, England is weakened", "Exactly. I still get one build. Sucks that I can\u2019t focus on Austria, but his terms were not sufficient.", "Good luck then.

I\u2019m attacking Warsaw this turn and will take it by next turn at the latest. Austria is going to support Italy into Smyrna or at least that\u2019s what he told me", "I want to take Paris and Warsaw next turn. Once I have those two extra builds, russia is largely taken by England and France is put to bed. My plan is to move on Austria. I don\u2019t want Italy to turn against us, but if he does I was england to be strong enough to help hold him off.", "I would have a conversation with england about what will happen with Moscow.

I'm not sure if you have anything else you want to do with A Sil ?", "Or maybe keep up appearances", "Gonna give Warsaw a shot", "exactly.

But we may be able to get something. Even if he lies we can potentially make deductions from his lies. Do you guys talk at all?", "Barely. For the opposite reason (me giving away stuff)", "Also, England has never responded to me", "I've also been amazed at how deaf italy has been to my chat about him having nothing to gain from austria winning basically all of turkey", "Yes, why is Italy so strongly joined at the hip with Austria? It seems unlikely that we will be able to pry him away unfortunately", "On multiple occasions has he been vaguely agreeable with my arguments to then try to stab me anyhow", "Also, like if your intel on the Smy attack is correct that changes a lot of things for me (in options)", "Like, from the outset that seems a relatively risky choice.", "Well, at least there's a way to force a stalemate from this position but I still lose 1 dude (and austria gains one)", "Italy supposedly is upset with austria. We'll see how it goes", "Really? Why? Do you think it\u2019s a ploy? If we can enlist Italy then there is no reason not to move on Austria immediately", "He's claimed to want to move against austria in various ways before to then try to stab me anyway. It had been only plays for me to lower my guard. I wouldn't trust him unless he makes the first move.", "Agreed.", "So this time I tried going into various strategies in why moving against Austria isn't as hard as he thinks it is. But he's acting not convinced. Anyway, I think there may be a path where we convince him to move together against Austria but it's not clear how to trust Italy after all that he's done before and how closely allied he's been to Austria", "I agree. I would wait for some secondary evidence from england or me before trusting him to turn on Austria", "It is unfortunate but I do not have winning moves remaining", "This is unfortunate if that\u2019s true", "I mean, it\u2019s depends on when we can turn on Austria", "Yes, that's true. However, if they play it right, as things stand, then there is no way for me to push forward without me losing something. Basically, without that 5th army the status quo is again slightly in their favor. Probably I will lose a unit every year ish, if not faster by the time I only have a few left", "Perhaps together with england I can hold the status quo but we'll see how that goes.", "Could you attack Ukr with War? I suspect it will support Sev so it can hold against my supported attack", "No, I already agreed to support Moscow with that unit , and he is supporting you into sev. I don\u2019t want to turn on Austria until the spring.", "Hm, that's another course of action he has huh. But he's not greedy so I'm not sure he'd do that.", "England told me he was gonna support you into Sev", "I believe him but it's not enough if austria plays defensively and supports sev from Ukr and Rom", "Then if I do go on the offensive it's very likely I lose something in my mainland.", "So gambling on austria being greedy is the wrong move imo", "Unless I can guarantee that I capture Sev.", "Hmm. It\u2019s your call. I would love to prevent Austria from getting another build", "Right. Is that possible?", "Only if you cut his support support, unfortunately", "And do what?", "But, if you attack ukr with warsaw you'd also cut austria's support on a possible att on mosocow", "So basically it's two birds with one stone.", "I can get into Sev and you prevent a possible attack on moscow", "I made a commitment to england already, so you have to convince him.", "I'll try and message him", "Look, it's very likely that A gal - war to cut your support if he makes an aggressive move", "Then the only thing saving moscow is if I attack Sev", "See https://www.backstabbr.com/sandbox/6340894809128960/1904/fall", "If I don't attack sev here, moscow would fall", "Hmmm", "I don\u2019t see what I can do to shift the equation", "Actually, you're right", "I may hit Ukraine to allow you to retake Sev.", "Sure, let's give it a try", "So are you going to move on ukr in spring?", "No me and england we thinking about jumping the gun in a last ditch effort to save sev", "But this turn I think (if I have the balls to do it) I\u2019m going to just dive into Austria", "And lets the chips fall where they may", "Great! I'm still coming up with their likely game plan. I'd like to not lose 2 centers in turkey by winter if I can prevent it", "What is your plan surrounding Ukr and Gal?", "No idea I literally haven\u2019t thought this thru", "I\u2019m hoping you and england can come up with a good strategy here", "I will get support from England to attack Sev. If you do A War- Ukr that will succeed and one of Austria's armies there will be disbanded", "That\u2019s great news", "So you're ready to help?", "Yes- let me set my orders", "I will help you retake sev. But I cannot hit Ukraine until the fall. I have to sure up my hold in Warsaw and my path into Vienna. I hope that is acceptable.", "Yo", "Ack", "Did you request england to not support my attack?", "I asked him to support Warsaw with the understanding that we will both support you into sev this turn.", "I couldn\u2019t help you in the spring because I risked losing Warsaw which would set the whole war on Austria behind", "I would've been happy to attack Rum or similar in this turn, which would make it much harder for austria to hold warsaw or Vienna at the same time, even if you had lost warsaw in spring. There's no way Austria could've held warsaw with you getting some support from England (attack of 3 strenght)", "That could be right, idk. But let\u2019s focus on helping you take Sev this turn.", "Hey Turkey - one of my big goals is to make sure you get another build in 1906. I think most likely this will be doable in Rum.", "I have to ask you something tho", "Sure, what is it?", "Just keep me posted if you hear any wind that people are going to gang up on me. Now that I have 10 units and they all have 7 I\u2019m a bit worried", "I\u2019m thinking king we may be able to have you take Rum this year", "Yeah I'm also considering Bul but I need to defend Ank as well", "When did you want to move on Rum?", "Maybe fall", "What are the plans in fall?", "Can you support my unit in War into Ukraine. I will use him to support you into Rom", "Congrats on the big retake!", "I feel like I turned on Austria just in time to save you haha", "Hi, sorry for the tardyness. I've just had a really busy weekend \ud83d\ude42", "Yeah, thanks. Slowly getting back into the game", "No worries. Would you feel comfortable supporting me into Rom? Then in the spring I\u2019ll move to Budapest and you can take rom", "I think it makes slightly more sense for me to take it this turn, because you won\u2019t have the physical spaces to build two new units", "While I'm not entirely opposed to this proposition I don't have time to fully consider it today nor tomorrow. I will just stay as I am for now", "Can you support me into rom?", "Or are you working with Austria?", "I'm not working with Austria, I'm just not doing anything.", "Down to support you into rom", "I\u2019m going to hit rom unless you want it.", "What\u2019s good man - hoping to chat before adjudication", "Hey, you still around?", "Yes", "I'm back from travels!", "Nice man welcome back!", "Okay, so rum sound good! I can follow up with my troops from mainland turkey as well before winter. What is your side of this?", "What would you like me to do for you?", "So I\u2019m happy to support you into Rum! But I would like you to support me into in Bud next turn if that\u2019s cool?", "Ok, fair enough. I'm a bit worried about englend going for Sev, though. Do you think he'll stay at moscow?", "Ukraine is supporting Sev into Rum", "Yes, I\u2019ll make sure of it.", "You are totally safe from england. We are in a position where if he fucks me he will get fucked twice as hard", "Ok great. I'm supporting with the fleet as well.", "Perfect. I can\u2019t support with Gal because I need to protect Vienna", "But I\u2019m supporting you from Ukraine", "Sure, yeah. I'm considering what he will gamble on. If you push into bud with +1 support then we either get bud or rum probably", "I\u2019m going to push into bud in the fall with your support from Rum and my support from Vienna", "But it will be easier once you\u2019re in Rum", "That will break the egg of Austria", "Ok! It hinges on serbia's support though", "How so?", "If both bud and serbia support rum then the attack will fail.", "F Bel\nA Boh S Tyr\nA Bur - Mun\nA Gal - Bud\nF Hol\nA Par H\nA Tyr - Tri\nA Ukr S Sev - Rum\nA Vie S Gal - Bud\nA War - Gal", "Here\u2019s my moves right now", "Happy to update them", "Ah ok, that looks good.", "As long as there's an attack on Bud as well.", "Sweet", "I really am kinda incentivised to hit him hard", "No, I believe you. We're all set up for this.", "Congrats on the pickup! I\u2019m so siked that we were able to turn the tables on Austria.", "Would you be down to talk longer term strategy soon?", "Yeah, whew that was close for me for a short while. Thanks", "Lol Austria just reached out to me saying he would support me into Rum lmfao", "He got really mad at me", "I\u2019m sure dude", "We just need to put him to bed at this point", "It's just a game. Like, i don't get it", "He\u2019s too intense it\u2019s wack", "He like found my IRL name", "Which really freaked me out", "There's some names on the info tab of the game I guess", "actually, if you go to <#601857887098372112> and click on your user, you'll see", "But the fact that they went to the effort... I don't know", "Sore loser I guess", "Just weird to me that\u2019s all", "We have a break over the weekend but you still want me to support you into Bud?", "Galicia correct?", "Yes please!!!", "I thanks man.", "no problem.", "Are you going to take bulg? I\u2019m playing with the sandbox and unfortunately, we can\u2019t take bud until one other territory falls.", "If he puts all support on bud I will get bul.", "Yeah I think we bluff that we\u2019re going for bud. I won\u2019t get it this turn, but will you help me get it next turn?", "Well that literally couldn\u2019t have gone better.", "I\u2019m thinking I take Serb and you can have Greece if that\u2019s cool with you?", "Can you help me with italy then?", "Potentially! As long as we can agree to some broader armistice. I don\u2019t want to focus on fighting you.

I'm not sharing your moves but I need some certainty so I don't end up pushing back on you and wasting my spring moves", "I wS going to move to Silesia or Ukraine but might just hold this turn and see what other people do.", "Prussia not Ukraine#", "Awesome, that's good to hear", "Are you going to Romania next turn?", "THinking about it.  What do you recommend?", "Have your army in Serbia support your army in Budapest to move into Romania. That way even if turkey tries to move into Romania you\u2019d still win and kick them back to Bulgaria.", "Good plan.  What are you doing here?", "Gonna try t9 take Sweden of at least knock Germany out and returning one army back to Warsaw to regroup in case I have to defend against Turkey for a turn or two while still pressuring Germany. Russia is too damn spread out haha.", "Fucking Turkey.  I'll help you take him on.  Keep that ship in the Black Sea, we'll need that one", "He\u2019s telling me to decommission it haha", "Of course he is.  That's bs.  That fleet is your best chance for staying in the game.  I'll help you out but you need to take him on with me", "You still there? I would love to talk about the future", "Yea I\u2019m here. I\u2019m with you on that. Not cutting my fleet and I\u2019ll work with you. What\u2019s the next Step? He was talking about leaving Sev to Romania which was prolly BS.", "he may try, but I wouldn't trust that.", "Even if he tries to move up to Moscow I can bounce him back to Sev anyway.", "He can't get Rumania anyway", "I don't think he will", "He wants to consolidate his units", "What\u2019s the plan then if I keep the fleet in the Black Sea?", "I'm getting information now", "I'll let you know tomorrow?", "Ok, sounds good.", "With Turkey building another fleet in Black Sea I have to do something with my fleet there or it could be destroyed.", "So we're going to move your fleet to Rumania here", "Supported by me", "Ok sounds good.", "Can we just check plans here? I'm supporting you into Rum, correct?", "Yea I have my fleet from Black Sea moving there next turn,", "Awesome", "Fuck, I did not expect T to go for Rum here", "Sorry you didn't get in", "It\u2019s fine. Looks like you\u2019ll be fighting the war in the south alone for a bit.", "What's your focus this fall?", "There\u2019s not much I can do really other than hold as I only have 2 units.", "Germany is a dick.  I told him not to do that", "Yea, he is. I fucked up this game. Was my first time as Russia and I pushed to pressure Germany way too early. Oh well.", "I could tell you were a new Russia, but that's not bad.  We'll get em later this game :)", "Come over to the Nexus! It's a large Diplomacy server with a great community and good gameplay.  You'll get a lot better there in prep for your next game", "https://discord.gg/P5vyvz8", "Seems everyone is fight8bg each other in the West and picking apart France. Should give you a lot of room to operate in the east before you start taking them on.", "Trying hard", "Are you going after Warsaw next turn?", "Germany says he is.  I would like to bounce him if possible and I told him I would too.  I need you to keep that center", "Ok thanks. I was going to move Moscow there to bounce anyone but now I\u2019ll just have Moscow Hold next turn.", "Doesn\u2019t look like Germany can move to Warsaw next  turn anyway.", "We're not allowed to share screenshots, but he said he's moving on Warsaw next turn", "Dammit dude, had you trusted me I would have put you into Stp this year", "Yea I know. I\u2019ve been screwed over a lot this game though haha. My bad.", "It works out anyway because Russia moved on you regardless, but you need him to move out", "Make it CLEAR to Russia that you're dying to England if he doesn't turn around and take England on", "Germany needs to turn around", "Yea. I\u2019m moving back to Moscow so it should be ok as long as I don\u2019t get bounced.", "I\u2019m pretty impressed by how well England is doing tbh. It\u2019s not always easy for them to do well.", "They're good at manipulating Germany.  Good at nothing else.", "Haha, good for them.

I can take on Russia if you do France", "You have a deal", "You're fighting a good fight.  I'm sending Italy around to help you out with France", "Germany is becoming a problem.

Those are two different requests.", "Ideally you take Germany on while he's shifting his stuff pointlessly east", "I can support it. Just don't support him in", "Why is it pointless? How does that benefit me?", "He was moving on Russia so he could reap the rewards of the Tsar's fall.  It wasn't the cause of any good will towards you.  He's an opportunist and with France locked up by you and Italy and Russia increasingly locked up by you and Turkey, there's only one place for him to attack", "He's asked me many times about the best way to attack you, and was setting up for it until I told him Russia was done.", "Would love to sit down and talk tonight", "Sure thing", "Can we talk long term here? What's the goal of the game? Where do you go now, with Turkey and Germany at the extent of your border?", "Would love to talk for a bit", "I'll take on Germany with you, but we need to talk it out.

I need your help to crack this dude, and I can't be running damage control for the board on my own", "can we wait until the fall?", "We really shouldn't wait.  I've watched him amass power and move into every sector of the board without resistance", "What do you want to wait for?", "Just curious", "I want to see how he moves before I full on stab him", "Let's imagine if he moves into Edinburgh and towards Norway....at that point it's too late to respond.", "Berlin will be in Prussia by that time, holding Warsaw against any of our attacks and threatening your single unit covering both Moscow and St Petersburg", "That's a two center pickup at that point and no one can stop him.  This move could determine the game.  I don't want to see us sleeping on the next three movesets", "Thoughts?  I know this is a lot to process, but I've seen a lot of Diplomacy games, and I've had some go south on its participants very quickly", "And I really want to finalize my moveset before midnight", "sorry, i'm on the west coast and still at work and still slammed", "give me an hour", "Good deal", "Anything?", "Yes", "I managed to piss Germany off for you \ud83d\ude09", "Germany is talking to me about heading back", "How do?", "So", "Heading back for what?", "I need to sleep soon", "You ask for a pause?", "Trying to decide if it's worth staying up for", "Any final thoughts?", "I submitted", "What should I expect?", "You want support into Warsaw?", "I\u2019m supporting you", "We'll find out in two seconds", "I\u2019m not supporting you", "Yeah I said that you lied on the last message lol", "Lol", "Not a bad turn for us I guess", "Could have gone a lot worse", "Glad that I at least got him to mess up your convoy lol", "Small wins", "What\u2019s the plan now?", "You seem pretty well entrenched", "That\u2019s a fair observation", "Is there any point in talking?

Would love to talk strategy at some point", "Hey Austria, yeah, I'm around", "Good to hear from you! How's your night?", "I'm kind of getting the grips on this game", "No worries! Are you friend of admin?", "Yep, get dragged into a lotta things. Must say this is kind of out there", "Anyway, Russia is kind of scary. They start with 4 units", "You play Diplomacy before?", "Yeah they are.  I'd love to take him out asap honestly", "I'm not sure I can do that much but I'm happy to help", "If you trust me, I can coach us both through advantageously", "You don't know who I am, but I was the #1 player on the Diplomacy app Conspiracy and I run the largest only Diplomacy tournament in the world, so I can coach us both through to a pretty good result", "Ah that's cool. Yeah I'm afraid I'm gonna get stuck in a snag somewhere.", "In general I was hoping to at least take the black sea and kind of capture the supply center in bulgaria", "I'm not so sure about what to do beyond that", "Those are both good starts.  I suggest sending that second unit to Armenia", "It will make the attack on Russia far more effective in the future", "Like setting up a move sequence in chess", "I read that sending the smy to constantinople was good", "Yeah, that's a typical move too", "The Arm sequence indicates a hard commit against Russia, which is why it's not quite as often used, but I'm hard commiting against Russia so I would love for you to do the same", "I'm happy to support you if I can get sevastopol", "That's the hope!", "How would the army to armenia play out? I suppose the fleet in sevastopol either goes to black sea or rumania. Probably black sea... Do you plan to go to Rumania first?", "I wasn't planning to go to Rum first, should I?", "Alright, will you be able to provide support to attack sevastopol?", "Can I do it in the next spring? I'm not adjacent to Sev here", "I could go to Rum for some more support to assault sevastopol?", "You could.  I suggest it", "That went pretty well", "lol, amazing", "Good work!", "Glad to see Russia down a peg here", "Nothing? Whats the plan here? Unfortunate for the two of us that Russia left that fleet in the Black Sea :/", "Yeah I'm not sure what his play is. Russia seems very inconsistent", "I think I'll need a few turns before I could move north to attack russia though. What is a good plan from here?", "Looks like you're pretty committed North already, the fleet builds sold it", "You're in a good spot.  You should take the Black Sea here, that will give you a ton of leverage in the future", "So are we just coordinating anymore? You might as well just tell me you want to attack me", "Hi! I'm actually away from home so I haven't been paying too close attention yet.", "Yeah I'll take care of that fleet in Bla. Then with +1 support it should be easy to move on to mos", "Looks like we were always at war with Eurasia after all", "Seems as if.  What's the plan?", "Poor russia", "I feel bad but I ended up going to sleep before I got a response from you so I figured you were out to attack me", "Very poor Russia.  The worst possible start", "You squeezed him too hard and now he's dead \ud83d\ude26", "I didn't squeeze him haha", "But yeah, we had a good mutual effort there", "Mutual, as in, he got his stuff destroyed while he got walked over huh", "I mean, he's partially to blame of course", "Anyway, i don't think I'm doing too badly for my first gae", "I haven't \"attacked\" you so far either nor have I had the opportunity to", "besides claiming centers that are close to me", "You're not doing badly!", "Just need to keep that momentum going", "Eh, I'm good with what I have/had.", "An attack of strength ~~3~~ 4: for when you really really really ~~really~~ want that region \ud83d\ude2d", "Yeah.....", "Italy is such a pain in my ass", "I must say I agree", "You online?", "Yep", "It's going poorly for me but I'm a rational player so if you wanna suggest something go ahead", "I'm thinking. It's tough because I'd rather keep it clean than overtly lie to you, I'm not that type of player. Honestly, you're in a tough spot", "Sure am", "You request the pause?", "So believe it or not, I may actually have to work with you if I don't want E or G to win", "I believe you because I can see that happening too", "So plan out a fair strategy.  Wouldn't be surprised if you were mad but I'm willing to put some of that shit behind for the good of the game and the players on the losing end of it", "Alright, but here's the thing. 2/3 of turkey is occupied by you and italy. So the payment would come out of your own pocket", "Like, I'm willing to look beyond there and consider maybe russia or italy", "I'm willing to sacrifice a little but not much.  I'm the main line of defense against Germany rn.", "At least you're semi reasonable about it.  Many aren't", "I also don't want germany to win. And I can see that you're being pressured", "If you were to fall to germany (completely) that would be bad for me too", "Right", "My guess is they're looking to draw it out at this point unless someone has a 1909 stab", "Englad is getting some reinforcements to Stp now", "Yeah, I see.  We need to move this turn", "Honestly I should have reached out last turn but I thought I had a good guess left in me", "i think if we can come to a nonagression accross the Turkey Straits that would be beneficial for both of us", "You can use the armies stationed there now for your defense while I rebuild and attempt to go north", "That's fine", "If you are okay with that then I will take Con, build an army in Ank and then take Smy", "You don't need Con and Amy right now.  This only works if we give up what we have to.  I can give you Con, but your units won't have anywhere to go after that, esp if we can't break you out of Sev here", "Is this about moscow? I don't have a way to hold onto that yet.", "Yeah, but we have to move fast, esp as that English reinforcement is coming soon", "As they lock down, we need to move fast and keep them guessing", "If I would be able to take Moscow with you support then in Fall I would be surrounded by three angry armies", "Is there a step two to this plan?", "Frankly, I'm not sure we get far anyway, but we don't get anywhere if Moscow is supported by STP next turn", "I can see what you're saying but I am not afforded the luxury of a gamble at this point in the game", "You're not, but you won't later either.  You can still hold Moscow with your fleet plus my army, and worst comes to worst, your army would be loose behind their front.  The alternative is we continue to attack you and we all lost out.  Italy, me, you", "I don't want to play that game", "I think the only way I can hold moscow is if you move A rum - Sev while I go to moscow. Then next turn we can hold it.", "For you to hold Rum, then, you'd retreat A Con - Bul simultaneously", "Of course my fleet cannot support my army in moscow", "Why not? Genuinely curous", "Oh, never", "I misread your statement", "Oh, so give me your moves right now, I want to confirm this. I have to sleep in a sec", "I'm not going for moscow. It's too far of a stretch at the moment", "Hey, I'm going to be away for a bit but just wanted to prod you prior to that about plans.", "I hope to stay neutral for now though I'm not sure what germany & england will think of that", "To be upfront with you, I'm not particularly happy with your moveset", "I gave you Con to solidify our line and you not only didn't do that, but you attacked the remaining stalemate ally", "What do you mean by solidify the line?", "Against the Germans and the English?", "I think we agreed to a ceasefire? The moscow plan was very wild at the time. I'm going to be busy for two days so I'll stay as I am for a bit and not attack any positions.", "I plan to build a fleet in Con unless you have a better idea. I do not plan to do anything with said fleet. It's just for my own protection.", "I'm read to attempt some push in the coming year if you have a suggestion", "For example, I could attempt A Sev- Ukr after I move A Smy-Arm", "Such that in the season after I can do a supported attack on moscow or something else.", "You're a dick dude.  I will make sure that that's the last one you take.  I'll let E/G walk over me of I have to", "I don't understand why people kill their own chances to survive games.  What's wrong with holding the line? It's so frustrating playing with players that would rather sabotage themselves than work with a teammate", "You exist because of me.

I still cannot tell who Russia is working with", "Neither can we really. Okay, then I still need to be nervous about what France is up to and whether it\u2019s me.", "I think you may be right. If you still have  proposal for an attack against France, let me know", "Oh yes. France just waltzed across the DMZ line he agreed to, so it looks like my nerves were spot on.

There are rumors of a Western Triple, but I think if we strike west (okay mostly you) could resolve the situation there while things are still resolving in the east.", "Queen! Sorry for the delay.  I say yes, but probably can't help much for another season or two (I don't want to overcommit). You should have unencumbered access to France this season though.", "Barring the entire French military lined up at my border, of course! I'll see what I can do. At least he's not getting any deeper into Italy.", "My friend, why? France still isn\u2019t going to make any progress... unless you open the door for him by attacking your two natural allies from Munich and Bohemia of course. \n\nStill hoping this is part of a clever ruse on your part, or that you\u2019re headed for Russia somehow. \n\nCentral Alliance!", "My fellow Queen, I can assure you my primary focus is Russia. I\u2019m trying to work with Austria against him, and then hopefully we don\u2019t have to worry as much about the east!", "That is a relief to hear, my fellow Queen. I\u2019m hoping to begin pushing back against France in the new year, and the Army in Tyrolia is fairly key to getting that process begun.", "England and I will be happy to help you as we can, if you can work on swinging Austria towards Turkey.", "England should be communicating as such too", "Austria will help me kill Turkey when I'm in a position to act against Turkey myself. I'm encouraging him to work with Turkey in the interim to keep Russia in check, but until I can safely move away from France - safely, not just with a season before he turns on me again - we can't afford an eastern war.", "Ok, that makes sense. Let\u2019s keep each other posted on the Austria/turkey/Russia situation", "Absolutely. And if I can help you two silence mini Napoleon, I will.", "Hi fellow queen, hope you had a nice weekend \ud83d\ude03", "Do you have plans this season? Have you been able to coordinate with Austria? England and I are wondering what you\u2019re thinking so we can all work together on figuring out what to do re:France", "Austria seems more concerned with Russia/Warsaw at the moment, not sure what you two have communicated about", "Hi fellow queen! Yes it was good, I had a wonderful (and rare) chance to spend a couple of days with my SO so I appreciated the slow update time and wasn't as much online as usual.\n\nThis season I'm mostly expecting to be fighting France. I'm glad to see him rushing back to defend himself against you two, but I'd be a poor friend if I left you to fight him on your own after you'd come in to save me in the first place. I'm hoping I can get some pressure on Marseilles, and I'm seeing if I can get around him into the MAO maybe.\n\nWhat are your plans? Any way we can coordinate usefully?\n\nAustria is mostly looking at the east, although he did say he was glad to see we had England occupied with France. So that's nice.", "What did you do with yours?", "Hi! Sounds like a nice weekend! Mine was good too, I went to a bachelorette party", "I am trying to set myself up to team up with Austria against Russia, but not spread myself too thin either...I am trying to decide if I should attempt to bounce with France again in Bur, but if he moves away from you into Gas instead, it leaves me surrounded", "I think the deciding factor is what and when we do about England. He's potentially a very strong ally for either or both of us, but only if he's prepared to fight against France and then northern Russia only. Otherwise he makes it very hard for you and I to cooperate against an eastern enemy without keeping an eye to our west, don't you think? I'm hoping to move into France this turn, but I'm unsure if I'll be able to clear Marseilles until Fall.", "Sorry for the delayed response! Been busy with school stuff.", "I hear that. I've been sick and just trying to catch up on school things today. Hope the bachelorette party went well? I've not actually been on one of those, what sorts of things did you do?", "At the moment, I\u2019ve been able to cooperate well with England and he seems willing to help us out against France and Russia, so hopefully it will stay well balanced a little longer. He\u2019s apparently been busy as well so I\u2019m not sure his plans yet. At this point I don\u2019t think either of us can count on France as an ally haha, so I think it\u2019s best to keep England on our good side for now", "Oh no, hope you feel better soon! The party was fun, we went out for dinner, etc and stayed at a house in the mountains", "I agree, and I think we can safely consider France as doomed. I'm not saying England isn't sincere in that goal as well, but I'm trying to look at next year's problems. Or the year after that. When France is down and we're looking at what to do about Turkey - or England as the case may be. \n\nProbably if I sat on Portugal/Spain/MAO I could quite comfortably work with England, but that puts him into the position of going through you or northern Russia. Since you haven't tried to play me yet (or you're doing so well I haven't noticed yet lol), I know who I'll pick if I'm forced to.\n\nThanks! Yes I'm better now, just headachey. That sounds amazing, and I love the overnight together with friends. It sounds like so much fun, and a chance to catch up with her tribe before she marries into a new one :3", "Yes, I agree.  I\u2019m worried about England turning on me before France is sufficiently weakened, I think the two of them are still on decent terms (hard to tell with only these one on one conversations)", "Which... is probably why it's set up this way.\n\nCan you tell me what happened with Holland? I asked England and he changed the subject. Was that agreed?", "Haha true", "Honestly your guess is as good as mine hahah. It was not agreed that he\u2019d take it but it was agreed that he\u2019d give it back", "It managed to spook me. I still see him at 7 units, though I know he's settled down a little. 2 Armies and 4 Fleets... still makes him the most powerful person on the board. \n\nWhich makes the division of France important, I guess.\n\nDo you care what I build with my French builds, when I do?", "Anyways, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve tried to play me either, so I will have your back when the time comes!", "England asked me if I'd been organising a proxy war against him... then seemed surprised when I had to ask him what that was \ud83d\ude02", "Apparently France is telling England I told him that I was nervous of England's builds (which is true) and that I was trying to manipulate him (which is not)", "I don\u2019t have a strong preference. I will probably build armies next time I\u2019m able to in order to work in Central Europe, so maybe by building fleet we will balance out?", "Interesting....Yeah I can\u2019t really tell what his long game is. I get the sense he was worried about making too many enemies from the get-go which is why he pulled back a bit", "I know you have no particular reason to believe me, but I don't lie in this game. I tried back when I played face to face and felt guilty as well as being incredibly bad at it, so it's easier to play an open game and just try to be mindful of what I say to whom. So, yes, when I saw France pouring in from the West I was very open about how nervous England made me (about the same time I was screaming to you for help lol). \n\nEngland has been very very keen for me to take on Turkey. Which I'd like to, and may mean he'll be attacking Russia then, when he's sure Turkey will be distracted from sharing in the centers. So hopefully that's what he's up to, and not looking at our centers more locally.", "But -- if and when we fight England, we're going to need the fleets to do that. So without particularly planning to fight him now, I'll be watching the ship counts all around between you-and-I vs him.", "Yes I agree, and too hard to keep track of what I\u2019ve said to everyone \ud83d\ude02", "See? Truth is SO much easier \ud83d\ude02", "Face to face I would actually blush and start giggling if I was trying to lie to someone and they showed *any* doubt. So... yeah. Poker isn't my game I guess.", "A few seasons ago, England was worried about attacking Russia while turkey was still strong. I think for him and I both, Turkey makes us nervous since we have less of a read on him. Unfortunately I haven\u2019t heard much from England recently, so I am in the dark at this point. I hope it\u2019s legitimate life stuff getting in the way and not him ignoring me", "Have you heard from him much since the weekend?", "We had a looooooong chat yesterday, when I could open my eyes. Over a dozen messages. That was when I was accused of the proxy war and had to ask what he was talking about. I didn't feel especially coherent, but reading back the messages look better than I felt. \n\nHe's very busy though, I know. So probably if he's not talking to you it means he's sure of you?", "Ok that lines up then", "Lines up?", "With what he's told me and when he messaged me last", "Oh ^^ When did he tell you what we'd been talking about?\n\nLike I said, open book here in Italy!", "Not much! Just that he told me he was busy and couldn't discuss. I wasn't;t sure if it was a clever excuse to stonewall me or not haha", "Ohhh haha", "He basically just said I could give him a moveset for this season because he's too busy to discuss anything.", "It's probably the 1:1 thing then", "Soooo if you have any input, I'm all ears", "Maybe encourage him to try for MAO and then descend on Brest next season? I don't know really. I want to see him get into northern France, but I'd prefer to see you do it.", "If I cut support from Bur, he could take Pic?", "That could work! I'm concerned about what MAO would do, but he'll be mainly trying to fight England off I guess.", "Never mind, he apparently already entered them. I *think* he's generally holding in the west, trying to push east", "He's being a little vague, is he? I guess it could be nerves... but I wish I knew what he was doing. \n\nI'm trying to hold Marseilles and push into Spain, for the record.", "Yeah the only specific was that he's holding in Bel and he agreed to let me have Swe and get another army built for working East. I'm not sure if he wants to keep fleets  in the west or not....guess we will find out soon enough \ud83d\ude2c", "Indeed! Grabbing some food, but I'll be around after adjudication to look at the map and chat. Will you be here?", "Interesting. Looks as though one or both of you have made up with France... again?", "Congratulations on making it to 7 though, that was a beautifully timed move.", "Sorry I missed you- ended up going to bed. and thank you!", "I'm not sure about the France situation. I personally didn't talk to France at all this season. Maybe England still trusts France enough to leave him alone?", "Seems like England forgot to enter his moves.....", "My queen of the north... how committed are you to your attack on Austria at this point? As you probably noticed, Austria and I had just begun our attack on Turkey and now he is determined to double back and face you which I imagine means a new deal with Turkey and the reconstruction of AT block. \n\nUnless.\n\nIf you *are* committed to destroying him, maybe it's time we worked more directly together you and I?", "My fellow queen, I didn\u2019t want to attack Austria, but I even more so didn\u2019t want to go after you or prod the English beast yet. So, I had the one choice of supply center to stay competitive this winter and Austria had made it too easy.  Perhaps I should have waited longer.....but it was bound to happen at some point I suppose. I would be open to working with you to destroy and divide up Austria and turkey. Let me know what you are thinking.", "That seems like our best channel to make some significant progress in the game at this point. As Italy I'm generally reluctant to fight Austria if it's avoidable, but I'm in the same position as you now. I can't go West (or I couldn't at that point and now all my units are in the wrong area) and I can't fight Turkey without support. \n\nNow appears to the the point where we can resolve our local situation nicely. Ideally I'd prefer to appear to be moving to stop you in the Spring and then declare my true allegiances in Fall if that works for you? Maybe I could move to Tyrolia \"to bounce you out\" only to end up there instead, giving me more angles against Trieste in the Fall? \n\nThe more France manages to stall or tie up England the better for us at this point, I think? There will come a time when we need to fight him to get to our two-way, and if we can get a significant number advantage before England catches on then that's all to the better. \n\nI don't know; what do you think? \n\nIs it time for us to reach for that advantage?", "Yes, that all generally makes sense to me. I\u2019m about to head out for the day but I\u2019ll take a closer look at the map and your suggestions later today and get back to you so we can coordinate for next season. I think we can make this work.", "In the meantime- have a nice Labor Day!", "You too!", "Ok, just looked at the board closer and I can't think of any better ideas, so lets go with your plan. And we can feel out how well Austria manages to coordinate with Turkey and decide from there how to proceed. Austria said Turkey is mad at him, so I'm not sure how strong they will be together, although I assume they will be forced to ally out of necessity", "Oops I maybe misread earlier, not sure if your intent was for us to bounce in Tyr earlier, but result was the same \ud83d\ude42 Are you still planning on using that unit for Tri?", "No, it worked \ud83d\ude42 My intent was to tell Austria I was moving to Tyr so that I'd bounce you if you moved there (true), but I didn't actually want you to go there. I'm happy with where we both ended up, and I'm definitely looking at Tri (provided I can preserve Ven in the doing).", "Are you about to lose Vie? I'll try to empty Tyr this season. I'd prefer you not move there if possible, Boh would be better.", "Perfect!", "And  yeah, I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll have to retreat from Vie. I\u2019ll stay out of Tyr", "Congrats on Tri! I\u2019m going to retreat into Boh", "Thanks! Austria is understandably annoyed with me. I\u2019m not sure it will help to explain why, but I\u2019m going to try it anyway. ^^", "Well done with War! No build loss then.", "Haha yeah Austria started sending me generic threatening messages too. He made a comment that \u201cboth of you betrayed me\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure if he was referring to me and you, or me and Turkey.", "He\u2019s accusing me of eating pasta now. Be still my beating heart.", "Wow, what a low blow \ud83d\ude02", "Hey there, how was your weekend?\n\nI'm looking ahead to this year, probably cleaning up Austria and what comes next. How do you want us to handle England? I'm presuming the two of you won't have much trouble with France if and when you want it, but I'm not sure you have the fleet power to take his home centers unless you surprise him or build up immensely.", "Hey! Hope you had a good weekend \ud83d\ude42 Yeah, I expect Austria and France will be gone soon. Honestly I haven\u2019t really decided what to do about England....", "I need more fleets, but I also needed armies to take on Austria, which is why I\u2019ve basically just build those so far", "I\u2019ve been keeping clear of Vienna as \u201cyour rightful territory\u201d; are you ready to reclaim that this Fall, or want to leave that for a later turn?", "I appreciate it! Yeah, it would be nice to reclaim this fall, but I\u2019m still unsure about how safe Mun is without support from Boh", "Oops never mind about Boh, I can support with Sil now", "Are you able to support me into Vie this season? Also, for when you\u2019re deciding on moves: sounds like Austria\u2019s primary focus is Tri, although he mentioned potentially trying to get back Bud.", "It depends what Austria does. Currently the only unit I can use to support Vie is in Bud, which you warn me will have any support cut. Right now I have Bud helping against Serbia, but if we feel that Vie is more important that can change.", "Ok that makes sense! I\u2019m fine with you keeping Bud helping Serbia this season", "Ahhh I misunderstood. I thought you were cutting Vie... oh well ^^", "Oh no! Sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear :/", "We live and we learn! \n\nNo you were clear, I just misunderstood. It made sense when I went back to check.", "What do you think of our shared King of England? ^^", "So far he\u2019s always followed through on his word", "He mentioned wanting a three way tie between you, me, and him", "What about you?", "Same. We haven\u2019t made many deals, but so far he\u2019s played ball. I\u2019m happy to go with the three-way plan. I don\u2019t have any allies this side of the board who seem able to stick with a plan for a year at a time, so I\u2019d prefer to work with you two.", "Sounds good. I\u2019m happy with that plan too", "Hey there! Could you please support Bud - Vie in spring and then I\u2019ll vacate it to you for Fall? I\u2019m trying to squish the last Austrian units so Mun - Tyr would be amazing too but I\u2019ll work around that if I need to.", "I was thinking of moving Boh-Vie. Was there a reason for you to get there first?", "Only that I suspect Turkey is going to cut my support ^^ I\u2019m happy to support you in there, but I\u2019m not confident I won\u2019t get cut.", "While if we squash them, I\u2019ll get out and you won\u2019t be sabotaging me in the Fall love", "Move", "Very happy to follow your lead though", "Ok, I just played around with a few sandboxes...I think best bet is for me to go for Vie this season (i can use Gal for support) and move Mun-Tyr to force Austria to disband. Then you can focus on getting Tri and/or fighting turkey. I def trust you to vacate Vie, but it seems like there is a chance you and Turkey would bounce in Bud in the fall and then we\u2019d get stuck. What do you think?", "Turkey said he\u2019s going for Greece this season but I don\u2019t really trust that", "I\u2019m happy with that. As long as we force the disband so we can end this thing \ud83d\ude03", "Sounds good \ud83d\ude42", "Did you get the same message I did from our noble king? <:GWowoHehe:358278238675664896>", "Haha yes I did", "So... do I sweep on into Turkey? I can take them, but if you and England are expecting to take a share we should talk about approach routes", "A while ago England and I talked about Turkey, he said he\u2019d use his unit in Moscow to help me into Turkey, although idk exactly how that will all play out. I\u2019ll talk to him about it (and you can too) and keep each other in touch", "Ok England is going to support me into Ukr this season, and I think Sev eventually", "Can you please support Ukr - Sev?", "I already have \ud83d\ude03", "Danke \ud83d\ude42", "I'm not especially interested in trying to steal an advantage here. How do you feel about using your A Sev to deliver the killing blow to Ankara and then we settle with a 3-way draw in Winter 1910? \n\nIf you'd prefer to indulge in a bit of regicide I'll be your willing ally, but I'm aware that looks like a risky proposition with my extensive southern estates.\n\nYour call, Kaiserin!", "That's just what I was thinking! I will move towards Ank on land (unless you want to set up a convoy in the Black Sea) and we can settle with the 3-way draw then", "It wouldn't happen fast enough if we only have two more moves. I'll support you into Arm, and then into Ank and click the box to adjudicate early.", "True. I just realized we only have two more seasons. I was a bit leery of the fact that I'll leave Sev open for England to move into, but with the time limit I guess it's a moot point", "Just to make sure I understand correctly, you're saying to click the box to adjudicate once everyone submits orders in Fall 1910?", "Yes please", "It will just help us get there a little faster.", "You\u2019re on board with the grand convoy of 1910?", "England said you were too", "Yes. From Nwy to Syria, while you punch into Ankara. Party in the palace in Constantinople?", "Sounds good to me!", "\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89", "Sweden to Syria then?", "Yes!

{"messages": ["Hey neighbour :3 If we put our minds to it, we can either work amazingly together this game or flail pointlessly at one another while other powers rise and rise (and rise). \n\nI\u2019d really like to work towards option one, so let\u2019s agree not to attack each other between Ven - Tri? At least not this year? We have more important things to do.", "That sounds good to me. I'm wary of Germany, will you watch my back if I watch yours?", "I haven\u2019t heard anything from Germany to suggest they have designs on you, but I\u2019ll keep an eye out in comms! We all have a stake in keeping Tyrolia free. Have you spoken with Russia yet?", "They seem nice enough just wanted to be careful since they haven't been speaking as much. Russia seems nice enough, haven't really gotten any info from Russia.", "Russia said something to be about an alliance before, the three of us against Turkey before we turn our gaze westward. Did he mention that to you? And if so, how do you feel about it?", "Italy vs Turkey is almost classic, though it does depend on an agreement like the one we discussed ^^", "Well turkey just told me that he was in an agreement with Russia. Not sure if that is to try to threaten me or if Russia is just playing everyone.", "Hummm. Maybe you and I should both query Russia on this and compare notes.", "Juggernaut would be no fun at ALL", "Russia talked about previous experience and using that to suggest going for turkey. I'd believe that, but I would also believe he playing both sides to try to Turkey then hoping to jump myself in the aftermath.", "Or he could even be lying to Turkey for a S01 advantage, though that could be a little concerning. I doubt I\u2019m in the winning draw this game but I\u2019d prefer a little more success than being someone\u2019s grab-bag of points ^^\n\nIt\u2019s early yet, but how do you feel about an Italian Greece?", "It'd be nice if Russia would at least let us know a bit. How do you pose the question without making russia suspicious?", "I subtly said \u201cI heard this. What\u2019s going on?\u201d", "I didn\u2019t say who told me mind you :3", "Okay, I'll hold off and ask later so it isn't too obvious it's us talking.", "Oh I hadn\u2019t thought of that. Good idea!", "Fairly conventional openings all around really, unless you\u2019re concerned by A Gal. I see either you or Turkey could deny Greece to the other, but if you move in you lose Serbia as a build.\n\nWhat if you support me into Greece instead (from Naples) and I can then either support you into Bulgaria next year or attack southern Turkey by sea as you prefer?", "I'm not immediately concerned by russia's move, but it doesn't exactly seem in line with how he seemed to be aligning with us. It could also just be a soft open to not put turkey on edge. Ill support your move into Greece and by then im assuming we'll see how Russia intends to play.", "Works for me. I don\u2019t lie as a rule in these games, largely because I suck at it and it makes me uncomfortable so believe me when I say Russia\u2019s comms to me have all been pointed at fighting Turkey. \n\nI\u2019ve asked him again what\u2019s going on. Keep you posted.", "It seems the fight Turkey has a positive effect for all three of us so I think that would be the simplest action, would also make since to lie to one person as opposed to two.", "I'm also planning on moving my fleet into the ADR just a heads up", "He tells me he forgot to change his initial orders to Galicia (which may be true) and that the fight vs Turkey is still on (which I do believe). \n\nYour logic supports this as well, so I\u2019m going to take my life in my hands and empty Venice this season, heading south.", "Thanks for the heads up, but why?", "Good point, realized I could support Serbia from land", "F Trieste moving to Albania then? I\u2019d ideally like to see a DMZ in the Adriatic, if you agree?", "Yeah, that works fine for me", "Serbia isn\u2019t really under threat at this point. Worst comes to the worst and Bulgaria attacks and cuts your support, but if you build A Bud this year you should be good to advance into Bul in 1902 with Italian support", "Speaking which, need me to get out of the way of your F Alb, or is it staying on your coast for now?", "I'll probably stay coastal until we push out Turkey then figure out from there", "That works fine with me.", "So... about that support into Greece? Looks like Russia lied to both of us as well.", "I'd believe it, though they said that they made a mistake moving into GAL and were going to move into Rum. I think that the plan to take out turkey is still happening.", "you want me to support you into greece?", "Well not any more since I'm in there. Fortunately I  didn't need the support you promised me last season ^_^", "Honestly the way russia has been playing i'd rather they make the big pushes into turkey with our support. I feel like that gives us the best opportunity to not get double crossed by russia with the aid of turkey", "Do you need my support for that, or am I good to focus on keeping France out of the Mediterranean? I had been planning on doing a second fleet and convoying into Syria, but I'm a little warier of Russia than I was last season.", "I think i'm fine so far, just wanted to let you know my thoughts on russia.  I get the feeling that they will follow through until turkey is done, but that point not sure what they're next move is.", "Or how much that may be impacted by England in Norway now. You would not BELIEVE the press I got from him earlier today.", "From russia? Threat from England may benefit us and allow us to get more territory from turkey when the dust settles.", "From England. It's not really relevant to our discussion, but I'm still a little angry about it. \n\nCalming though, don't worry about an emotional loose cannon to your south west ^^", "Always good to hear", "Russia said \"their orders didn't take\", kind of suspicious giving everything previous. I think they're trying to let either Turkey or I make the first aggression then decide who to support from there.", "I think you\u2019re right.", "Maybe he keeps making interface errors, but I think he\u2019s being cagey and trying to keep his options open until you two commit.", "So... does that mean we do want to commit to Turkey? Or do you think we should try to seek common ground and you two hit Russia while I... do something else I guess?", "I think im just going to hold until I have a clearer idea of what's going on. Russia said in the beginning they have experienced multiple games so I doubt they managed to make a mistake twice in a row.", "Alright then. We have time to consider our moves over the next 2 days, but I need to brainstorm to what I can do against Turkey if you're not able to move in my support. \n\nCan you make any suggestions? I don't see a classic Lepanto working against two Turkish fleets facing west.", "I can support your army from Gre into Bul with my fleet in Alb if you want to move into turkey. I'd like to my russia side armies where they are in case russia tries something funny. Any thoughts?", "Otherwise I want to try to get a better understanding of Russia and turkey's plans while my units hold", "Okay yes, please support my army Greece to Bulgaria with anything you can. I understand wanting to keep a firm border with Russia. What are your plans for Army Trieste?", "Was going to let it sit, but I can move it to Ser if that makes you more comfortable. Don't want to move to Bud and make russia think im antagonizing.", "Don't you already have an Army in Ser though? \n\nIf you don't want to do anything in particular with them, you could always bounce yourself in Vienna from Trieste and Budapest? Personally I'd be happier seeing your army not next to my open home center, but I get that Russia is a bigger (more enigmatic) neighbour that you'd prefer to avoid provoking.", "Still new to this really. I have my fleet and arm supporting you in Gre moving into Bul. Thought I could also move my other army into Ser", "Since we have two days to make decisions. Have you considered allying with Turkey and moving onto russia? Purely speculative, but we could try to get England to push from the top and Turkey and I push from the south. Then you and I watch Germany and France to make sure they dont take advantage of England.", "I\u2019ve considered it, I think I even suggested it. It puts a lot of weight on Russia, probably enough that even he gets smooshed fast. The problem from my standpoint is that it doesn\u2019t give me a lot to do with my two strong allies fighting north, although I suppose I could take Tunis and then move west against France? \n\nI\u2019ll want a firm agreement and an open border if we do that though, because if I\u2019m going to break into France I need to take virtually every  unit I have.", "Bed now. But I\u2019ll be up in a few and will look out for your thoughts.\n\nGood night!", "I really am nervous about your units in Albania and Serbia. I'm not sure where I'd prefer your fleet to be (unless you want me to \"kill it\" so you can rebuild as an army?\") but I know that between that and your build in Trieste I keep getting more suspicious than you deserve.", "Part of that is probably France's fleet in Spain (south coast) as well.", "I'd personally prefer my units unkilled, have both of those units currently set to support you into Bulgaria", "realistically the only real worry I have now is russia, I'd like to clear up something to my west that keeps me from getting sandwiched so im not really trying to fight with either you or germany.", "Are you sure? There's a time honoured tradition of friendly \"kills\" helping with unit conversion, and it would give you an extra army instead of a fleet that's mostly trapped... ^_^ \n\n\nNo, you're right. I guess this tension is getting to everyone. I'm not prepared to go to Bulgaria this season, so please don't worry about supporting me with either unit. In one of my attacks of paranoia earlier (after you didn't support me into Greece - don't worry, I'm over it!) I agreed to Turkey's request to support him into Serbia from Greece this season - a decision I now regret.", "Would you prefer I tell him I'm not doing it, or that I go through with it and you block the supported attack? I wish I'd drawn another power, or that the alliances were more clear, or that we had *any* idea what was going on in Russia's head. \n\nI'm used to F2F play in school.  This is very different, and much murkier. And I'm still worried about France. Maybe a cautious expansion to Tunis this year is more my speed...", "this is my first experience with this game so im not sure how to proceed really. all i know is that russia seems to be trying to play everyone", "Oh goodness, we are doomed then. I'm not much better, I've played a couple of games with very mixed results. I agree that Russia seems to be trying get everyone onside though!\n\n Do you have a mentor or a friend who's played before? I'm considering asking one of my diplo friends for advice, but I'm not sure if that would be against the spirit of the study.", "I asked the admin, he's happy for us to ask more experienced friends for tips. :3", "To explain context, I was very spooked by your building a new army right next to my undefended home centre (in Trieste). Vienna is at least safely 1 centre away, but in Trieste means I *can't* leave Venice open no matter how much I trust you. \n\nGiven I'm moving to Venice this season, can we please move back away again rather than staring at each other over the border?", "If you're not sure, then it's better we don't do anything too bold. I'm going to tell Turkey I don't feel comfortable supporting him in attacking you (I don't) and that we should all stop and look at Russia for a bit.", "Okay, to clarify then. I have my arm in Tri moving to Vie, and Alb and Ser supporting Gre into Bul.", "If you're not attacking then i will just have my units hold or support", "I'm not attacking. If things settle a bit and I have some assurance about what France and Russia are doing (and with the relief of Trieste opening up), maybe we can explore this in Fall to give him limited time to respond.", "I am moving A Rom - Ven this season, but mostly because I'm concerned with what France is doing. If he goes somewhere other than Pied, I'll move back south or arrange a fake \"fight\" over Trieste if you like. \n\nIf we arrange a bounce, it could be interesting to see who tries to take advantage of our apparent squabble :3", "that would be interesting to see what happens if it appears we're fight. I'll have my Ser and Alb hold then", "I\u2019m glad I moved West! Imagine the damage France could have done if he\u2019d broken through Venice and popped up on your other border? Let me know if you need any help from my boys in Greece who will otherwise eat souvlaki and catch up on their classical education :3", "yeah, I guess france is trying to get hostile and must have some sort of non-aggression with germany and england? England asked if i got the memo on Russia, do you know what they're talking about?", "I believe Russia has been offering people a lot of deals - nothing we hadn't already suspected though.", "I'm curious what the memo was and who was sending it. Did england say anything to you?", "He told me that Russia was trying to organise a northern alliance with him and Germany, but I wasn't certain how far I believed it. It didn't seem to make much sense with the moves we were seeing, you know?", "Had heard that. Russia told me they was supporting me into bul again, but I don't think I want to make moves. I think if we can at least get Germany on our side, Turkey Germany, and myself can take out Russia.", "Well Germany should want a strong Austria, right? Though I admit I'd prefer Germany help me with France!", "it's up to you, I'm fine slowly taking russia out and moving my army in Vie down to support  you in Ven. If you're comfortable with that.", "I'd welcome your support from Tyrolia? That should help us to push back on Piedmont if he doesn't change direction now he knows he's not going to surprise me.", "Alright, I'm going to talk to Turkey to see if they're interested in make the push. Also I'm waiting to get a response from England one what they meant about the \"memo about russia\". If they make a push from the north we can probably take out Russia in a few seasons.", "Any word? And are you still able to support my A Ven to Pie this turn? England is up to 7 now which makes me a little worried about his ultimate intentions as he may be a more polished version of our Russian neighbour (but with the centers to run for a lead, if we aren\u2019t careful.)", "Yeah. I'm about to leave Vie exposed to russia and move my fleet from Alb into Tyr. Are you talking with Turkey? Maybe support either them or me from Greece while we attack Russia in Bul?", "I spoke to him this morning, he suggested I support him into Bul as part of your joint push against Russia (and a small part of it I can actually reach to support), so I agreed to do so. Is that a problem? \n\nIf you\u2019d prefer I do something else, please let me know; I consider you my closest ally.", "No that works perfectly for me. That's what he just told me his plans were so I think we can trust him until russia is no longer a threat.", "Also I have tyr supporting ven into pie", "Then I will order Ven-Pie and use my fleets to counter him in TYS and in Africa. Once in Piedmont my army should be able to hold the connection with Marseilles and it becomes a fleet battle again - where I have him 3:2.\n\nMaybe I can persuade him to go away and worry about England growing at his back.", "Yeah, england is certainly getting some momentum", "Possibly in the interests of board-balance we should offer a treaty to Russia after we clear the immediate area while he\u2019s still strong enough to threaten English Scandinavia?", "We could. All I know is either russia or Turkey is going to end up out of here based on our actions. Russia told me Turkeys moves didn't do anything to them and that they'd still work with me, so I'm guessing they know that our decisions make or break them.", "Are you alright with me moving Tyr to Vie to prevent russia from trying to take it?", "I\u2019m fine with that, my French front is stable now thanks to your well timed assistance! England and Germany are hoping you and I will help them deal with Turkey\u2019s expansion after France is driven back (but privately I think we need to be careful how large England gets in the meantime).\n\nWhat do you need from my A Greece this season? Do you need me bringing units back east, or am I clear to keep chasing France?", "I agree about the eastern front. I think Greece is fine to move back to help your push.", "I'll see what I can do when I get a fleet into the right waters. I'd *like* to have that army over West, but not at the cost of losing two units for a year getting it there.", "What are your plans this season? Are you ready to push up into Galicia and points Russian, or are you still eyeing Turkey?\n\nI can't get Greece out of there yet, but hopefully if I can get a French build I can build something that will let me move it away... although we are going to need to look at Turkey eventually I know.", "Looking to push for Russia. If we split on Turkey early it will only end with all of us getting overrun. Once Russia is done we can figure out how to move from there. It seems like england is fighting France and germany now so no one is going to get too much for free.", "I agree. There's no sense in a war with Turkey at this point, we just need to keep an eye on his builds and where they're positioned. I'm probably tied up in the West at the moment anyway so there's a limit to how far I could help, but... I think maybe I should leave A Greece where it is rather than trying to come up with an excuse to move it back there when we're ready.\n\nHow was your weekend?", "Yeah, I'm always open to a little support no matter what.", "Congratulations on your build \ud83d\ude42 How are things in Austria? \n\nWith Russia descending in flames, where would you like us to look next? \n\nI'm still tightly embroiled in France, but I'm pretty sure I could get free of them if you needed me elsewhere.", "I'd like to to go after either England or France next, but obviously I can't help too much without moving through either you or england. Once Russia is completely gone we could move on Turkey? I told Germany the only way I see any of us surviving is by working together and that the first person to betray the other two would probably just last a little longer. So I'm fine trusting the center and moving my armies east and south once russia is gone.", "Russia is down to 1 center. I'd say unless you're strongly committed to not fighting Turkey before Russia is dead we may do better to move now... and offer the last Russian center to Germany as part of a deal to keep them off our back when we move?\n\nThe question is what we expect EG to do while we're moving on T. I don't have an answer to that right now, but swapping straight back to Triple has to be a temptation.", "What do you say?\n\nDo you want me to move east now, or stay in the west with France?\n\nI agree a Triple Central Powers benefits us all here.", "Depends what you're comfortable with. We can probably take out Turkey fairly quickly after Russia if we put our mind to it. That would certainly make me feel safer not having any threats to my east. But it also looks like you're making good progress in the west.", "I'm concerned about what the other people will be doing while we do that. You're not wrong though. I could hack my way slowly through France, but that frees England to work his magic on Germany after Russia falls. \n\nAlternatively if we move on Turkey now, an angry France will probably turn back on England... or at least I hope so. \n\nOh! If it comes up, England asked me if you're \"doing what I tell you, or doing what Turkey tells you\". \n\nI said you were listening to me, which is strictly true even if it doesn't mean you're like my puppet or anything. Just so you don't get the wrong idea if you hear it in press. \ud83d\ude02", "Change of plans I'm building fleets and sailing for England.", "Lol. Don't underestimate him though! I think he's very good at influencing people on the other side of the board to do what he wants, and if he's underestimating you then that's his mistake - and not one I'm going to make!\n\nHe challenged me that I was running a \"proxy war\"  with France, and he then had to explain what he was talking about before I could respond. I think maybe he's doing something similar, trying to keep the rest of the map in a state of tension while he carefully expands.", "Yeah I'd believe that. At least he was nice enough to explain things as he sees it.  If we're going to move on Turkey what would you think the best course of action is? I think you moving your fleet in Ion to pressure Smy and Con would allow me to move and take either Bul or Sev. And then your support could help us take Ank with either the fleet or your army in Gre?", "Maybe I could support you into Bul in the Spring, if you have Serbia covered? \n\nMeanwhile I move my fleet up to menace Smy and Con where you suggest, and then you can support my A Gre convoying into Con - or attacking Smy if that seems more vulnerable?\n\nOnce we're past Con and have him out of position, he should be easy enough to pull down before the West gets out of control. How many fleets do you think I should bring East?\n\nHow many should I leave guarding the Med?", "That seems like a reasonable plan. I'm trying to get Germany onboard with taking out England in Stp so we don't have them meddling in the East. I think at this point Russia is basically a non-factor, unless we really get out-maneuvered. Once I get some sort of confirmation from Germany I'll have Rum move into Bul, and Gal into Ukr with Bud moving into Rum. Should I start moving my fleet down into Alb do you think?", "I was going to say I\u2019d prefer it stay put, but actually... how do you feel about the Adriatic? That way I can leave my A at Venice and then maybe you can convoy me into Albania in Fall? It obscures what we\u2019re up to a little longer and gets more Italians in to Turkey", "Before they can expect us.", "I can move to Adr, Im going to move Gal into Ukr to prevent turkey from taking it and move Bud to Ser- to offer more protection.", "turkey told germany they were moving to ukr, but i haven't heard anything from them so im assuming they know whats coming next for them.", "How do you want to handle the attack into Bul? Do you want me to support you in, you support me in or you attack and I convoy into Smy?", "Hello? Coming up to a decision point. I'm currently moving into Bul, but very happy to change if I hear from you in time to change my orders.", "Sorry, been a bit busy with real life stuff. I'll take your support into Bul and then we can move further into Turkey.", "Any thoughts on how you want to split the territory?", "Okay, I'll support your A Ser to Bul?", "That would be great.", "In the long run I'd like to split it evenly, so if you can help me get into Smyrna in the new year and eventually you have Bul/Con and I take Smy/Ank that puts us in a good position to move into Russia when we need to and gives us a solid border to face back west.", "Weren\u2019t you convoying me across the Adriatic? A little concerning about Germany, given they\u2019re denying you the build you deserved for Bulgaria. Maybe I can help?", "I misread you previous message as a choice between my attacking with support or convoying. Hopefully my reading error doesn't set us back too much.", "Also looks like Germany is allying with England. So I'm going to have to move my units back to address that threat", "Since your F Adriatic doesn't need to be anywhere else, could I please get that convoy this season? Apu - Alb? Unless you need my army in the north of course, please let me know.", "I'll move Pie to Tyr this season, and bounce any attempts by Germany to move an army into Tyr", "Sure I can convoy. What's happening with France? You're moving all your units my way, and after the whole shakeup with Germany it has me questioning what's happening.", "At the moment my plan is Turkey, just like we agreed?\n\nI don't want to go anywhere to make you nervous - if you prefer I leave Tyrolia to you, then I will. I'm just concerned about your northern border being bare.\n\nWhat would you like me to do?", "Okay, I'm now in Tyrolia and Albania thanks to your support.\n\nWhat would you like me to do at this point? Support vs Vienna? Probing Munich? Support you into Con or replace you at Bul?\n\nTalk to me, friend Archduke.", "I'm going to take back Vie, your support would help it look like Germany isn't going against England. After that I'm going for turkey again. Hopefully we can convince Germany to make some aggressions against England soon, they're getting way to strong for my liking.", "Okay, so Tyr to support Bud or Gal to Vie? \n\nDo you want me doing anything with Greece or Albania, or get my fleets around his flank and start supported convoys into Smyrna?", "Bud please", "Now that's just rude", "You\u2019re not wrong, and I am sorry about that. For the record I was wholly committed to our attack on Turkey, so that\u2019s the reason I was moving over. Germany\u2019s stab and your necessary pull back to deal with it meant I had to stop and think and talk with everyone and... here we are.", "at least when my people die they'll die knowing they honored their alliance. Have fun under the boots of england.", "Brave people and true.", "Can you say the same pasta eater?", "I'm obviously fairly heavily committed to my attack on you at the moment, but I do consider Turkey's shenanigans around Bulgaria a breach so before I forgive and forget I thought I'd offer you a chance to negotiate. \n\nAny interest, or war to the knife?", "My people dont forget", "That's fair. Neither do mine, although they do forgive.", "If you don't get off all those high horses your cavalry won't have anything left to ride on.", "You win this time, Chef Boyardoesn'thonoralliances.", "I honour every alliance, to the letter. When we were no longer allied against Turkey we were no longer allies unless we agreed on a new goal - and we didn\u2019t.", "I wish you better luck in your next game.", "Unilateral decision making on Turkey.

{"messages": ["I've been on both the giving and receiving ends of multiple games in which Austria, Italy, and Russia decided that their games would be much simpler if there wasn't a Turkey around, and it always was. I propose that we start the game off by coordinating a removal of Turkey before moving on to other priorities.", "Seems well reasoned, coordinated, direct and decisive. Just what I like to see out of a prospective partner for the future when I'm an enthusiastic rather than dangerous player! Sure why not, I'm in - if I hear from Austria that he is as well. That would remove a lot of pressure off my immediate borders and have me looking to a future decorated in Winter and Green. What do you think?\n\nOh, and hi there!", "Sounds excellent to me. Italy/Russia is a very strong long-term alliance.", "So I've heard! I've played exactly one game as Italy since I discovered Diplomacy online (still ongoing) and our Wintergreen is presently well on the way to a three-way draw with France. If mostly because I can't persuade the Tsar that a two-way would be more interesting.", "So tell me, how do you find Terraforming Mars? I'm a bit of a highkey space fanatic and one of my friends has been on me to try it forever, but I don't find I have a lot of time for gaming. Worth a look? Or something that's fun but not for long?", "I've played about three dozen games at this point, I think, and every time there's something new or interesting that happens. Heartily recommended.", "Ohhh I must try it then. I dabble in Kerbal when the mood suits, and I'm definitely into intrasystem expansion so it may be a great way to while away sleepless nights.", "No news from Austria yet, but it's a global game and a lower chance of NMRs than usual. I'll worry if I haven't heard from him in 12 hours. Some discussion with Turkey, he seems keen for me to attack Austria and for him to expand to Bulgaria and Greece which... is fairly classic play I guess?", "Yeah, no one is really doing anything out of the ordinary as far as I can tell.", "Agreed, I was briefly concerned about the risks of an Anglo-German alliance, but nothing coming out of either power suggests that was any more than my paranoia at work.", "If we don\u2019t hear anything from Austria, should we consider a reverse on your original plan? Russia, Italy, Turkey vs Austria - and then Russia and Italy vs Turkey when the time comes? The West will be so relieved they aren\u2019t looking at a Juggernaut I\u2019ll be over the southern stalemate lines before they can stop us.", "I'm fine with that. No matter what, I'm planning on you and me eventually crushing someone between us, be it Austria or Turkey.", "Heh, insomniacs unite. In the spirit of full disclosure (and full diplomatic flexibility) you can generally reach me within 2 hours at most, day or night. I don\u2019t sleep that well - but happily that\u2019s a benefit in the global game! What is it, 2 there?", "Just about. I'm not good at sleep schedules.", "And, looking forward to it.", "Hey there! A little bird whispered in my ear that Turkey thinks he has an agreement with you. Since Austria has finally popped up, which alliance is real?", "Hello? Opening moves look largely in keeping with your suggestion against Turkey, though Galicia could mean Austria is the focus. What is the plan, alliance partner?", "I'm sticking with the anti-Turkey plan - the Galicia move was an initial move that I forgot to update.", "Gotcha, you may want to reassure Austria of that too. I know I\u2019d be alarmed if I was the Archduke looking up to see the Tsar\u2019s Imperial Guard on approach! \n\nMaybe use Galicia to seize Rumania to prove a point, and allay Turkey\u2019s suspicions with your apparent attack on Austria this season?", "Exactly what I'm planning to do.", "Great! Sorry, I'm still new to this so when something neat occurs to me I feel the need to share my brilliant and original realisation XD", "It's all good!", "You gonna take a shot at Greece?", "Do you think I should? I\u2019m strongly considering it, but there\u2019s a little voice that says not to risk the bounce and stick with the build I know I have.", "Well, I told the Turk I'm supporting him into Rumania, when I'm actually supporting the Austrian into Bulgaria and myself into Rumania. So, if you go to Greece, you get the build, and you cut off the Turkish retreat, so he's stuck at 3 and we're all in place to crunch him down.", "Okay, that sounds like a reasonable call I guess. Even if I bounce it denies him the retreat option, although if I\u2019m stuck on 3 while you\u2019re all collecting 1-2 builds I worry I\u2019ll spend the game trying to become useful again.", "You have my word that if you're left build-less, I'll give you priority in getting Austrian dots, you'll have my support in.", "Alright my friend, I\u2019ll do it.", "Oh... you lied to me. Why?", "Oh what the fuck Backstabbr, I swear to you I intended to do what I said, but the updated orders must not have taken. Goddammit.", "Ugh and now I've got to build an army in StP, because of England", "I understand completely :3 My second online game (which is still ongoing) is on Backstabbr, and two of the other players could not swear enough about the format. \n\nI haven't had any problems myself, other than accidentally ordering a fleet to move to an impossible Bulgarian coast and losing a year fighting Turkey (in that game).", "Both Turkey and Austria are concerned about your movements and are asking me if I trust you.", "I don\u2019t think they suspect our discussions though, so there\u2019s that!", "Is a Western Triple what I think it is?", "England, Germany, and France working together, yes. Bad news for both of us.", "Mmm. I\u2019m starting to suspect that\u2019s what\u2019s happening yeah.", "France remains the question mark. But if he\u2019s coming for me, it looks like it\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard", "Uh oh. It looks like France is committed then, and I find it unlikely he\u2019d leave himself wide open to England and Germany if he didn\u2019t expect them to take his side.\n\nHow are things on your side?", "I'm worried. We might need to recalculate.", "Welcome back! Haven\u2019t heard from you in a while, what\u2019s up?", "Alliance against the West?", "I sent you that message yesterday and forgot to do the thumb-reaction on it, didn't notice 'til the admin just informed me", "I think we have to, yeah. A blatant triple like this changes things.", "Well at least the triple looks like it might be falling apart early. Have you been in touch with Austria? He seems to have written me off.", "Just wanna double-check again in case my message didn't go through. At least the triple looks like it might be falling apart early. Have you been in touch with Austria? He seems to have written me off.", "Austria and I have been talking, we've been buddying up a little but I'm still mindful that at some point we're going to need to sandwich him to make our <:wintergreen:613143739954888734> fly. I did encourage him to listen to Turkey's advice though, after Turkey made a number of persuasive arguments and I've agreed to help Turkey into Bulgaria this turn.

I'm really not all about gaining the most SCs I can. There are other considerations, you know?\n\nSo you partly pulled back off France so I'd be stuck fighting him on my own so that... someone can apply the brakes to Turkey?

{"messages": ["Good morning my Sultan, how are things? We have a number of common interests (the Balkans, Austria, the Med, Russia) and I'm looking forward to discussing them with you. Please accept this gift of fine Italian Chianti!", "Buongiorno! I hope we can honestly discuss these interests as well. Are you planning to open agressively?", "Buongiorno!\n\nThere's only so aggressive I *can* be, Sultan! I haven't even mentioned the idea of a Lepanto to Austria and I'm principally focused on getting a build in Tunis or Greece this year. Where are you looking at things?", "Well, I would strongly encourage you to visit Tunis. In return, I'd be happy to offer you support if sometime in the future you decide the map has too much Austria on it.", "Well... Tunis is pretty much guaranteed for me, and it will be there in 1902 if I find juicier fruit in 1901. Are you suggesting I try my luck in Trieste instead, and that you'll be happy to support me the war against Austria that will likely immediately follow? \n\nOne of my friends is in another game where his I and a friendly T are advancing well against a chaotic Russia/Austria alliance.", "you had me at \"against Austria\". Yes, I think that the two of us working together against Austria/Russia would be a good plan. And later when we trust each other better I'm sure we could coordinate in the Mediterranean to help you expand westward  while I expand north?", "Some cautious discussions with Austria this Spring, and I\u2019ve committed not to try for Trieste this year so it looks as though it will be a single build winter. For you as well, or have you been able to negotiate safe passage to Greece?", "I'm working on it...If I get a promise from Austria I'll let you know.", "Welp, it appears that neither Austria nor Russia are speaking to me. This suggests they might be working together, in case that's useful information.", "That is interesting! I'm still getting press from both, though nothing that suggests a solid alliance between the two. Nerves, uncertainties and some remarks heard - directly or indirectly - from Russia that make me wonder what his long game is here.", "Last turn, Russia offered conflicting promises to me and Austria both (or so I've heard). Once I found that out, I never heard from either of them again. So it's not too many dots to connect to think they may have some kind of arrangement...\nI would guess maybe they plan to split the map roughly horizontally and take me out first?", "It could be so. It looks like they're not coordinating well if that's their plan, though. I was aligned with them last turn, but a few promises didn't quite flower to fruition and right now I'm more concerned with what France is doing in southern Spain.", "Apparently Russia just makes empty promises to everyone (so I hear from northern players, anyway), so I think it's best if Russia is just ignored or treated with extreme suspicion. \n\nYou mean you're worried about France seizing the Mediterranean?", "That was what I meant yes, since I ended up leaving Tunis for the new year. Seeing the bounce on Munich allayed that concern nicely though, and I\u2019ve exchanged a few notes with France since that convince me I\u2019m able to look to my East for a little longer at least.", "And yes, Russia does seem more than a little promise happy - does that make him a commitment phobe do you think, or is he counting on some of us to say no so he\u2019s not stuck in contradictory commitments?", "Probably the latter.\n\nSo, does focusing on the East mean that there's anything I might be able to help you with?", "That\u2019s a good question. \n\nClassicly I suppose I should be focusing on a Lepanto approach, and I\u2019m certainly uncomfortable with your fleets in Con and Smy. It\u2019s also the bill of goods Russia\u2019s been trying to sell Austria and I. \n\nOn the other hand that depends on us being able to trust what Russia is up to and frankly I\u2019m not certain of him at all. I was committed to supporting A Ser into Bul this year in exchange for his support into Greece... but if we go back to the order log we can both see that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nWhat do you have in mind? My immediate objectives are taking Tunis, keeping my coastal waters Italian and finding a friendship/alliance I can trust to take me to the late game, hopefully a 2-way draw.", "Ah, what a relief to finally hear what sounds like honesty!\n\nThose fleets were mainly meant to defend against a lepanto, and, fate willing, maybe seize the black sea that I naively ceded when I was young and trusting. Point is, they're not a threat to you especially since you're the only neighbor of mine willing to talk to me. They might even be useful for you in a few turns, if I'm still around.\n\nI assume you want do dedicate your Nap fleet to snagging Tunis. And does the \"coastal waters\" thing mean you're concerned about the Adriatic? If not, then, what I hoped was that you might be willing to support Bul-Ser while stabbing Albania from the sea. This could set us up to start pushing back on Austria from the South. (And I'd support *you* into Serbia if I thought that'd be worth anything, but given that Bul is surrounded by enemies I just doubt the support would go through).", "I'd like that, and I agree it's a huge relief to cut through the nervous diplomatic double-speak! \n\nI think it's perfectly understandable for Turkey to want to defend against a Lepanto, especially when Italy is sounding cautious and doesn't really have many other options to expand. I've just built a second fleet, but then I think I need that to escape my boot whichever way I'm going. \n\nI am concerned about the Adriatic, but not sure I'm moving into it this year. I agree with your analysis of Bul (you're GOING to get hit) although it might be hard to bring up a new unit into Bul to replace your army there. Are you hoping to feed F Con to the east coast? You might need an Aegean fleet to force your way up, which should probably be yours unless  you're willing to extend me that much trust this early.\n\nWe're assuming a supported attack on Serbia will get you in, yes? Austria does have a *lot* of units around there, cut at Albania or no.\n\nBianca de' Medici", "I agree with you that it's not likely to work given all the units Austria has around, but it's the best I could come up with. I was planning to move a fleet to the Aegean for support next season, as you suggest. \n\nDo you know anything about what Austria and Russia are planning?", "(also I'm open to any counter offers if you have them)", "Reliably? No.\n\nGenerally speaking I think they\u2019re trying to defeat you, but how they\u2019re planning on doing it I\u2019m not clear. They both lied to me last turn - and, as far as I can tell, to each other. \n\nI don\u2019t have a better offer really, except that if we make any progress against Austria I would expect Russia to start courting us instead.", "That sounds on-brand for Russia. It\u2019ll fall on deaf Turkish ears though.\nSo, can I count on your support?", "Yes. Let\u2019s do this thing, my friend.\n\nB. de M", "I'm getting nervous about Austria in Serbia and Albania, and I don't want to lose Greece. I'm also (sorry!) getting nervous about your two fleets facing west what with my more experienced friend telling me that Italy and Turkey \"always fight\". \n\nThat's not true, is it?", "I'm still not going to attack you, but... I think I can't attack Austria either here. Sorry. I need to sit tight and wait for Russia and France to commit themselves. Maybe France will butt out of the Med with his northern worries, but maybe he won't too and in Italy we *need* freedom of the seas.", "I understand your hesitation to attack Austria, but if you don't trust them then it's better to resist sooner rather than later when they become more powerful at my expense. \nYour experienced friend is wrong; there's no reason Turkey and Italy *have* to fight, even if it does happen somewhat often. In this instance, you're the last person on the board I'd want to fight with.", "Well, I'm glad we didn't agree to stab Austria, actually, since it looks like Austria has flipped on Russia. \nI'd still like to help you out any way I can, but it looks like you might be focusing on the west for a bit. Just know that as far as I can tell neither Austria nor I have intentions with Greece right now.", "(Austria did start to talk to me again and said as much)", "Thank you! I\u2019m much happier with my suspicions drawn to a worthy target, and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t start fighting Austria in the Balkans while France ran up my back. Do you have a plan for getting back control of the Black Sea? You certainly don\u2019t have to look out for me any more, we have a Frenchman to scold ^^", "Don\u2019t you worry about the black sea, this ol\u2019 sultan has a few tricks up her sleeve \ud83d\ude09", "I look forward to seeing what you do next, your fleets are certainly ready!", "(Sending to Italy and Austria)\n\nFrance, germany, and England\u2019s behavior combined with some things England has said to me smell of a triple alliance between those three. Do you agree or have any additional evidence?\nIf so, I want to make sure southeast europe is prepared to push back against such a threat", "A few things I\u2019ve heard sound Triplish and the current French position certainly looks like they\u2019ve made some sort of deal doesn\u2019t it? They aren\u2019t going to sneak by me though, so it really depends what EG do.", "So I know this is last minute, but I just got Austria to support me from Ser into Rum. I was wondering if you'd be willing to bump/borrow Bul this turn? I highly doubt Austria would try and swipe it from you", "I just don't want Russia to have it", "Too last minute sorry, I was asleep. I\u2019ll go see what happened in the update.", "It looks like you'll be able to push back on France a bit this year. I think you and Austria should work together to move you into Piedmont...what do you think?", "I was also wondering whether your Greece army might be willing to support Con-Bul ec?", "Good morning my friendly Sultan! Still a bit asleep here, but agree with both your points. Happy to support you into Bul (ec) this season, and very much hoping Austria will support me in driving France back out of my immediate area. How have you been? Nearing the end of a *very* long week here and looking forward to spending more time looking over the map.", "Well I'm so glad you'll be taking some time to get back to what's important. \n\nI've been not-so-busy and looking at the map kind of a lot...thanks for the support and I'll gently try to convince Austria in your favor as well", "Hahahaha. Well, it\u2019s Diplomacy and SO and not having to spend all day up to my ears in Campus things. But yes, important to focus on what\u2019s important.\n\nI appreciate your support!", "I'd sure hate to be France right now! Great job claiming Mare Nostrum \ud83d\ude42", "Thanks! How are things in the east? Still have Russia well contained or do you need anything from Greece or the rest of me?\n\nWe\u2019re at your service here, while not wanting to drive in where we aren\u2019t needed", "Don\u2019t need anything just trying to give credit where it\u2019s due", "Congratulations on your build! How are things in the East with Russia dying from all sides? Do you have any immediate plans for where we go next from here?\n\nI imagine France would be open to a deal that had me moving away... again.", "Sorry I didn't respond to this...I hope that move to the Ionian is not signalling that you're ready to turn on me", "I moved there so I could convoy Greece out, since he\u2019s not doing any good there any more. Did you have another use for him?", "Congrats on smooshing Russia so effectively!", "Ah thank you but the smooshing was so effective that now England and Germany are swooping in like buzzards! \n\nAnd that's a relief about Greece. Does this mean no truce with France, and you'll keep expanding that way?", "I haven't agreed a truce with France. If England and Germany were still attacking France, I'd absolutely be driving on hard (why I sent the fleet back for reinforcements) but now... I'm torn. If I keep hitting France, that frees England (and Germany I guess) to push through the last Russian centre and come after the three of us from the East, right?And pushes France back into their arms. How do I avoid that?", "Ah the truth comes out. In hindsight I should have realized it was too good to be true", "It was true at the time I said it was. But yes, negotiations went on.", "It's important to me that you do understand the situation changed there. \n\nWith both you and Austria advising the A Greece wasn't needed there my fleet came over for exactly the reason I suggested... but then after it arrived I had my French re-evaluation. And now Germany has jumped Austria and my ally seems to have lost his conviction about killing you, and so - why, I am re-evaluating again.", "Well at this point the only thing I could offer you as an ally is help in taking dots from Austria. If that's something you'd be more interested in than taking dots from me, then we could work together?", "On my way to bed. Let me look at this and come back to you in the morning. I think there is a definite chance, and if we do this I\u2019ll be perfectly straight with you before we start (and likewise if I decide to keep fighting you).\n\nThis will only work if we surprise him though \ud83d\ude03", "Sorry I ended up being basically offline all day (and I'm involved in a new tournament, so busy setting up those games). \n\nYes, I'm more interested in taking dots from Austria at this point than I am in taking them from you. If we schedule a bounce in Smyrna in the Spring, could I count on your support into Bulgaria in the Fall?", "Hmm long term I\u2019d sooner have Rum and Bul for myself while you take the western holdings...could we either agree to some temporary arrangement or could I promise you support into Serbia instead?", "That makes perfect sense to me. I was thinking in terms of what you could support me into, but if I can get that build this Fall I\u2019m happy to leave it and let you take it for the following year - and Rum too. \n\nBlack Sea territories are much easier for you to hold, and I need you strong if we\u2019re going to drive north together.", "Okay glad we\u2019re on the same page :)\n\nHave you heard anything from Austria/Germany that might affect how we should proceed? Austria claims to want to leave Ukraine open for me this season though I\u2019m not sure whether to trust it", "Austria is starting to get nerves about all my units heading this way, but I\u2019m reminding him this was part of our plan to kill you. Currently I\u2019m offering to help Austria defend against Germany where he\u2019s badly out of position.", "So am I assisting Greece into Bul this season?", "I'm also wondering if you're going to follow through on your promised assist of Austria into Vienna. I think if we're going to stab, it's better for you not to and to fall back to venice instead.", "That\u2019s up to you, friend. Normally when I stab I prefer to stab hard, but if you\u2019re having concerns and warning Austria about our plans then they weren\u2019t likely to work anyway. \n\nHow do you want to do this? Committed stab and pivot north or revert to our prior alliances and see if Austria is willing to commit to a direction - any direction - that I can support him to?\n\nYou know my preference, but I don\u2019t want to push you into something you\u2019re uncomfortable with.", "I don\u2019t *think* I\u2019ve said anything to Austria to indicate our collaboration, although Austria is suspicious anyway. All I did this season was ask whether you two were collaborating, to which Austria said basically \u201cI sure hope so but we\u2019ll see\u201d\n\n \nI\u2019m wholly comfortable with going forward with you on a decisive attack on Austria.", "Okay I'm committed. Let's do this decisive attack on Austria, with your supporting me into Bulgaria from Greece this season and my getting out of the way for you to take Bulgaria yourself in the new year. We'll work out how we break Rum, but if the best solution is me moving into it then we'll work out a schedule for me to get out of it too - Black Sea coastal territories are yours.\n\nAgreed?", "Agreed. I\u2019ve placed your support order.", "It's been a long weekend. Getting back into the dip mindset, do you think you can trust England to keep off your north?\n\nIf so, let's look at getting you Rum and Bul this year.", "I think that\u2019s a good plan. Are you willing to leave Bul this fall?", "Done! Taking Rumania in the Spring?", "If possible, yes", "I\u2019d also love it if you could move your fleet out of the Aegean and into greece or something, just to take a little presssure off me?", "That's fine. I'm using it to cover Greece this season.\n\nAegean DMZ?", "Agreed \ud83d\ude42", "Austria has asked me to support them into Bul this season. Since you're giving it up to me anyway and it will be useful to us to have their trust, should I do it?", "Oh dear I'm sorry it looks like to you didn't get my message. Let me know if there's some way I can make it up to you!", "Ouch! Unfortunately you\u2019re right, I wasn\u2019t around for your first message at 1:10 am and so wasn\u2019t in a position to suggest anything else. What does their trust buy us, other than forcing a disband of one of our units due to complete the defeat of our mutual enemy this turn?", "I'm really sorry I forgot that you're not in a U.S. timezone. I didn't realize it would be such an issue because to me, it just made sense that you'd move into Serbia with Bulgaria and support from Albania (so that support couldn't be cut by Rum).", "...and that trust gets us information. Like, for instance, I could have told you not to move with Albania if it weren't for our time difference issue. I really am sorry and I'll be more aware of it in the future", "Ah no, I knew you were attacking Rumania this turn so I waited in Bulgaria to ensure he couldn\u2019t simply retreat in there and offer you the same problem all over again in Fall. The move out was due in Fall (yes into Ser) so that you could reclaim your rightful Black Sea borders as scheduled \ud83d\ude03", "Not sure I have the armies to do that now; I\u2019ll look at the map when I\u2019m more awake, but may need you to take a more proactive role if that\u2019s okay.", "I'm already on it! I'll get back to you in a couple hours", "So, Con to Bul (ec)? I can support you there from Gre and if you support from Rum as well should get you back where you should be.", "I'll do that but just so you know Austria told me they were going for greece this turn.", "From where?", "Bulgaria", "Not a problem then - provided you hit Bul with Con supported from Rum", "Okay great", "That went more or less according to plan, thanks for your support!", "I want you to know that despite my move to sc instead of ec, I plan to honor the DMZ of the aegean. I was just being overcautious in case you decided not to honor it.", "Should we look into spring then? What are you trying to achieve this year?", "I was just asking myself that. Expanding northwards against Germany/England seems logical for me.", "What are your goals?", "Since Austria is... a little more back in the game than I\u2019d planned, they have to be my focus. After that I fully intend to stick with my alliance and drive to the final endgame. :3", "Just not looking at those moves yet"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true,

It's been a hectic week :)\nI think I'll stick close to a standard opening, get in position to drop a bunch of fleets", "Sounds good! Off Brest please - seeing them appear in Marseilles will set off all sorts of alarms in La Bella Italia ^_^ I\u2019m glad you\u2019re \u201conly\u201d very tired. What is it you do, when you\u2019re not governing the fates of a nation?\n\nEngineering student here.", "I design software systems for electronic health records.", "What's your focus?  I was originally an electrical engineering student, myself.", "Aerospace engineering :3 I finish my course at the end of next year and... then have to actually find work, if I can. I enjoy the university but don't want to spend my whole life in Academia, you know?", "No, no you probably do not want to do that.  \ud83d\ude03", "Nothing too new this turn, good to see you're on good terms with your neighbours - or at least good enough to quickly grab your neutrals this year!", "We should probably talk DMZs then, yeah? I don't have any intention of going into Piedmont any time soon, and really do either us want to see any naval adventures in the Gulf of Lyon, the Western Med or North Africa?", "That's the plan - and, yes, it would be very nice to keep the western Med area free of fleets.", "Anything I should be worried about there? England and Germany seem to be coordinating well, but at least they're leaving your borders well alone. Do we have DMZs in every territory I mentioned, or only the Western Med?", "We do, and we should be good. I imagine there will be fallout to deal with from the attempt at Munich", "Touching base, anything new from our friends to the West? And where is the Army in Marseilles headed? We Italians are known for our warm and personal hospitality, but prefer t", "*to extend that on a more individual basis than to whole armies at a time.", "Ouch! That hurt, though as you see we did spot you coming. Are you still intent on trying to force your way past my defense, or are you ready to talk? ^^", "Always ready to talk!  Driving now though - be a couple hours before I can pull up the map", "Now that I'm home, we could probably work out a set of moves that keeps me in position to move elsewhere next turn", "\"Keeps me in position\" and \"moving elsewhere\" do feel a *little* contradictory I have to say. Still, if we can avoid butting heads pointlessly for the next three years I'm all ears! \n\nWhere else did you have in mind? Your German and English borders seem a little bare, so I trust there are diplomatic ties keeping them safe and secure?", "That's the theory. And you missed the time component -keeping me in place this turn, so I can move the other direction next turn (which is harder to do if I advance this turn)", "You're not going to advance this turn. I appreciate the thought, but I'm already there and have nothing pulling me away in another direction. \n\nOr was that your point?", "More or less - but we need to make SURE I don't advance.  I mean, you can't effectively cover all of North Africa, Western Med, Tuscany, and Tyrolia, hence the getting on the same page \ud83d\ude42", "And that's what I was talking about - keeping me in MAO would have made it easier to flip in the Spring", "Ok, that works. Looks like some chaos between England and Germany we can maybe use to disentangle", "I think England is being very clever, and is using Russia's ambitious early play to get an advantage while you and Germany are committed. But then he's the same player who warned me about an incoming Western Triple a few seasons ago, so... \n\nHow would you like us to disengage? Planning on just turning around and going home, or something more dynamic?", "Good question. Stand by while I get a feel for what's going on with the rest of the board. How secure are you feeling with the Austrian?", "Reasonably secure. He's in Tyrolia because I asked him to come, if that's what you mean :3", "It is, yes. And funny enough, my \"full push on Italy\" order set last turn would have had me ordered there, but I was trying not to push too hard. \nI think I'm inclined to mostly just straight up go away, just putting one unsupported move to tyrrhenian to keep you from full-pressing a follow-up.  Does that work for you?  That would let you either force your way in and still put one on Ionian, or force Ionian and just use one to keep tyrrhenian empty.", "It does in principle, yes. It\u2019s after midnight here and I\u2019m heading to bed, but I\u2019ll have a closer look at the map tomorrow (today now!) and give you a fuller response then. Maybe we can plot out some actual moves then. Where was the one unsupported move coming from, so I can run a sandbox tomorrow over coffee?", "That would be Lyons. I was going to stay something cheeky, but it's actually pretty obvious which one I'd want to back up, and which is want to hold as a delay.", "Ugh, autocorrect making it look like I've had a stroke...", "So, not *quite* what you said you were going to do. \n\nI didn't mind disposing of the offending unit in Piedmont though, so you won't have to have him courtmartialed! I half expected a convoy into North Africa, though I now see you have larger threats to worry about to your north. Russia coordinating with a powerful England, and England and Germany descending on your open borders!", "Eh?  I did exactly what I said I was doing :)\nBut, yes, you can clearly see that not only was I already backing away from you, I'm now *highly motivated* to fully commit to that.", "The attack on Tyrolia wasn't *precisely* the same thing of \"I'm pulling back\" as I expected, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt I guess. I'm not really sure what you were trying to do there honestly, unless you were hoping to menace Munich from the south?", "*sigh*\nAlright then. Spain won't be supporting Marseille so you don't need to cut it -you'd just be helping England by doing so, and screw him. So if you want, you definitely have the option of shifting wmed - naf,tys - WMed.\nThat would let you take Marseille and be in position to still take Spain in the fall, and/or contest the mid-Atlantic.", "Agggh, I must have been half asleep. I didn't hit the thumb (or that was when the bot was down)", "Let me look at this and work out what we're doing.", "I was indeed hoping to menace Munich. \nFor this turn, I'm also willing to support WMed - mao", "I'm generally in favour of that idea. Where is MAO going?", "I am generally in favour of plan \"screw him\". I have a few reasons, and in hindsight I can see the strings tied to my shoulders from a few seasons back. Would I be fair in assuming he set you to fighting me at about the same time he warned me you were coming?", "So confirming you'd like me to move F WMed - MAO in Spring, and will support me there (from Spain?) if I don't cut you that season? If I can get Marseilles, Spain and ultimately Portugal I would be overjoyed... though I confess I don't completely understand why you're helping me do this. \n\nI think I need to understand?", "Yes, he's been pulling some strings. As to why,  with three on my doorstep, I'm going to lose dots. All things being equal, I'd rather they go to the person that didn't betray me.  As for mao, it's going to English. That may cut a support and you'll just bounce mao open. It may also walk in behind a moving English fleet and get you into mao. Hard to say. But either is better for you than letting an English fleet in. \ud83d\ude00", "I agree, and well reasoned. I\u2019ll keep your secrets (although he does have a knack for reading the board), and plan closely with you for next year\u2019s moves.", "Support's in the box - do with that what ye will.", "Thank you! I\u2019ll see to it that it\u2019s not wasted.", "So... we're changing back again then? \n\nI don't object to someone defending themselves, but you could have said something \ud83d\ude02 I haven't lied to you yet and don't intend on starting now.", "Sonafabitch - did I forget to hit thumbs-up on the last message?  Yeah, I did NOT mean for that to be a surprise to you, and I'm deeply sorry, cause you did me a solid and it looks like I reacted by being a dick.", "So the Triple is back on? I see England has decided he can afford to kill Russia now, though he hasn\u2019t asked me to distract Turkey recently.", "Nope. He's killed the triple idea for me. So... What pull would make you happy?", "What is a \"pull\"? I'm sorry, getting asked a lot about terms I don't recognise in this game.", "Oh! You mean \"pull off the board\"?", "I don't see any reason you'd be inclined to make me *too* happy if I was still trying to kill you, but since I'm apparently the only one doing that last turn I don't feel any particular obligation to stick with that plan either. \n\nIf you remove an army, I'd be happy to see that as a sign of good will!\n\nI do want to keep my build, but get that you wouldn't want to lose a home centre long term - right? \n\nSimplest answer if I go back east is to sit an army in Marseilles while everyone else leaves and lets you focus north. \n\nNext simplest is... A Mar moving to Spain I guess and letting you reclaim Mar uncontested?\n\nOr we could do something more aggressive, but without me in your backyard I'm sure you could make some progress against England, if that's who you're looking at?", "You sum it up well. Army gascony is probably the overall friendliest yet most ambiguous pull. It takes pressure off Marseille, but would let me keep pressing England if you backed off. And I'm happy to leave Marseille Italian for a while if the issue is off me - don't especially need that as a build spot in the near term", "We should talk about how we\u2019re going to disengage, so there\u2019s no confusion and no temptation to warn anyone what we\u2019ve got planned for them ^^", "I\u2019m trusting your fleets are headed north, and I\u2019m sending everything other than A Mar and F GOL (this turn) east. I hope to send F GOL East next season as well", "We're really on incompatible time schedules :)\nFleets are headed north, so is Burgundy.", "You may want to cover Spain.", "Cover or try to take it?", "Same thing, mate.

I think we need to start being concerned with Turkey and try to prevent him from creeping into russia's supply centers", "Of course", "I agree, but i think we need to worry about England as well.

Then Italy and I will be able to deal with turkey.", "Ah makes sense. Yeah England is growing quickly. I\u2019m trying to figure out the best way to settle things with France and England on my western border first, and then figure out the best way forward from there. I think England and Turkey will be tied up with each other to our East for a season or two which buys us some time", "So are you fine with me attacking Vie to keep up appearances?", "I mean no, not happy about it haha.

Please know it was only a misunderstanding \ud83d\ude03 I still have your back", "Did Russia confront you about the western triple? He\u2019s on to us", "Yes he did lol.", "Also how do you not know what demilitarization of an area means? Lol\nYou fairly new at the game or from another planet hehe?", "See now you put me in a pickle :/ that's why I confirmed with you that I was moving out of bel. I was expecting hol and ruh to be vacated as well.", "Although you've given me no reason beyond that for distrust so I'm staying with you and trusting you my queen.  \nOn another note Russia is kinda desperate and asking me to head towards France lol. Even offered me support into Sweden", "Are you there kaiserin?", "Gah sorry, it really was just an honest brain lapse, I was entering moves last minute while occupied in real life. Thank you for giving me another chance to prove my support!!", "Oh good you're online! :)", "Yes, Russia seems desperate. I think he got everyone against him from the very beginning. Italy is definitely working to find an alliance against France", "Has he made you any offers on Sweden?", "No specific offers yet, but they are definitely trying to scheme something.", "I suppose it will be more Mediterranean based", "Oh, no I was referring to russia", "Like has he made you an offer on sweden?", "Ohhh sorry. Was confused why Italy would be taking about swe haha. No russia didn\u2019t offer anything", "He just snarked about me ignoring him and his alliance, even though he was silent and uncooperative before", "Ok good. Well could you attack his fleet to cut support so I can get into stp?", "Yes", "Awesome! Thank you my queen. Also we need to discuss how we're going to split Russia. Turkey will want a piece of him too", "If I may ask, where are you from? Seems so hard to coordinate good time to talk", "Sorry I left abruptly earlier- had to run out for some appointments. Can\u2019t diplomacy and drive \ud83d\ude09", "I\u2019m on the east coast", "PA?", "Yes, I agree about figuring a plan to split up Russia. Austria is aiming for Russia too, so we can probably use him along the way", "Currently literally caught in the rain lol. I\u2019m all ears for what you have in mind re:Russia. I\u2019ll follow up later tonight when I\u2019m back home!", "Well I know this gonna sound a bit greedy right away but hear me out. If I get stp and you let me have Sweden you could have the rest of Russia and I believe that to be better because it keeps us with more clear defined borders.", "I like to operate on 100% trust and I feel like we got off to a slightly rocky start with the misunderstanding of the DMZ", "But I'm open to your opinions and suggestions to my queen. This is a joint effort", "Also to make sure we ARE on the same page this time, hol and ruh will be vacated this turn right? France and myself already kept our end of the deal. I need your confirmation on this so I can vacate nth as well instead of having to cover bel", "Yes, I will vacate hol and ruh. I understand how that made me appear to be flaky, but I can assure you that I'm devoted to this King/Queenship. It will be corrected this season", "As for Russia, I think I can agree with your proposal, but first I'd like to understand a little more how to see France working in all of this. France was originally on board with this alliance, but has been less vocal, so its hard for me to gauge his commitment level", "Right and based on the uncertainty we will have to act accordingly with him when the time comes", "And thank you for confirming", "As for right  now he keeps Italy busy for us from which we both benefit", "Oh hey you never got back with me whether you agree to the proposal on Sweden, stp for me and the rest of Russia for you?", "Sorry for the delay! Yes I can agree to that", "No worries my dear. And thank you :)", "I think after this turn we need to start making wedding plans lol", "We could invite all the nations to attend and bear witness to the consummation of our commitment hahaha", "You moved into Hol- Are you no longer in favor of a DMZ? France and I upheld our end of the bargain this time around.", "Yes you did in fact. Paranoia got the best of me :/ with everybody getting getting so very suspicious about a western triple :(", "Where do we go from here?", "You're  willing to salvage this?", "Potentially,  but I\u2019m worried that you and France are trying to push me out of this triple", "Your silence is troubling", "I totally understand, my apologies I was busy working to put up the last wall on this cabin before  most of the guys here left", "Hmm I put myself in a tough spot.", "So how would you propose we move forward?", "Hmmm", "What do you think if you let me take Swe this round and then I promise to allow you a clear path/support to take StP as we discussed before. That will throw everyone off the western triple suspicions, and we can move forward together. What do you say?", "Hmm to much back tracking imo", "What do you think would be a better option?", "I'm super busy with work right now. Throw me another proposal.", "You can focus on moving towards StP and I\u2019ll move towards Warsaw", "Im up for other suggestions too if anything comes to mind. Hope work finishes up well!", "Thank you, yes it came together nicely :)", "Ugh I'm truly at a loss as to what to do :/  I get along with you so very well with yet if I attack russia then Turkey will be real  hard to stop will be a long term problem.", "The other thing is I have only stp to gain from a war with russia.", "Also france seeing my moves was real quick to jump on the opportunity he sees for himself and wants Munich", "I think really the only option I have other than continuing an invasion on you would be to attack france", "Ah I see your point(s)", "Hmmm", "IF you are in fact willing to salvage this \"thing\" we have hehe, invading france is the only option I see.  Russia poses no threat now and if france gets attacked then Italy is   free to put the brakes on Turkey for us", "Also what on earth is Austria doing?  That's the other thing looks like Turkey has Austria in his pocket", "Well obviously I\u2019d say to attack France haha.  But more than that, I think that we work well together and can continue to do so. I am on board for a salvage! I haven\u2019t communicated as much with France, and he seems to be doing his own thing heading into Italy anyways. I think that Austria is trying to support Italy into France? I think he wanted to work with Turkey against Russia, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what\u2019s actually transpiring", "(Sorry if you got that multiple times due to me trying to send while bot went down)", "I get that we work really well together. But honestly what good is that if it's to our detriment?", "Im saying the 3 of us", "I do know for certain that france is moving to bur.\nI discouraged  the move but he was very set on it. Said that he doesn't need mar unit against italy anyway", "Hmmm good to know. I believe that Austria is supporting Ven into Pie, but nothing we can do about that at the moment", "Italy did say that they can get austria to cooperate  agaisnt austria so there's  that", "Maybe let's you and me tell italy that we are ready to help them out if they can swing austria towards turkey?", "Yes that sounds good", "Okidoki", "And to ease your heart a bit more this sesson I'll  let you in on a lil secret ;) I'm moving towards france and away from you. I really do want us to work, paranoia just got the best of me last season and I know that's not a good thing for a good relationship. I will reward in kind", "Why thank you \ud83d\ude42 I do appreciate it", "Ok, I've told Italy", "Great!!  And one final thing\n\nTHANK YOU THANK YOU  for being such a strong  queen. That is a thing of beauty and worth", "Ok well I'm off  to finish the roof. Have a good night ttyl", "Is this my own fault?", "What are you referring to?", "France's  moves", "Hey are you available to chat real quick?", "I won't have time tomorrow", "If you don't have time rn. Could we at least bounce in holland?", "Sorry for delay, I am traveling this weekend, haven\u2019t had much time online", "My main priority now is getting another supply center before winter", "Have you cut some deal with Russia already for a sc?", "I admit i made a hige blunder in an attempt to put the brakes on tirkwy. You can have holland back", "Ok, thank you!", "No I don\u2019t have any deals yet", "Also I  had a question.  Did you and france communicate  about bouncing  in bur?", "We did a few seasons back, but decided against it. I was working on a hunch.", "Hmmm. Wonder who warned france", "Im trying to hard", "Take holland for real and I'm  gonna slow down and coast along for the ride", "If turkey gets out of his corner so be it", "Haha ok sounds good! I haven\u2019t heard from anyone else over the weekend, don\u2019t think much scheming has been going on", "So france just decides all on his own to \nSwing up for an attack on me? A bit odd i think", "Honestly we only had talked about what he was doing with Italy and Austria", "I see", "Hello my queen how was your weekend?", "Hey! It was busy but good. How about yourself?", "Also- thank you for letting me have Hol back! \ud83d\ude03 I really appreciate it", "Very worky hehe", "You're very welcome!! I think that's the least I could do after taking it out of stupid paranoia lol", "Haha no need to worry", "I think that was the last labor pain for the birth of our glorious alliance! ;)", "But I'm glad you had a good weekend :)", "How you want to move forward now?", "Cheers to that!", "I want to walk with you side by side", "Hmmm i haven\u2019t thought about my next moves yet. I can\u2019t tell who France is trying to work against. Seems like Austria wants to cooperate to get Russia knocked out, so I\u2019ll probably work with him in Central Europe a bit", "Ok sure :). In the meantime I can deal with France's uncertainty together with Italy", "What are you thinking?", "Turkey is doing his thing!!!", "Oh cool, sounds good!", "Yeah I was hoping Italy could help out with France more, seemed like they were still concerned with turkey though, last time we talked", "Hmm board wise they look very concerned about France and not so much Turkey. They even supported Turkey to a sc", "That tripped me out when I saw it", "Oh you\u2019re right. I guess I\u2019ll touch base with Italy again about it", "Yea that'd be good. From my perspective Italy is way way to committed west.", "Yeah.  I will keep you posted!", "Very much appreciated", "Sounds like Italy is trying to capture Marseilles. I am considering trying to  bounce there with France again in order to make that happen, not sure yet", "Whether you bounce or not marseilles will fall because Italy can cut Spain support with wes", "Might be better if you could support bel>bur", "Yeah good point", "The potential problem I see with me supporting bel>bur is that Italy has voiced concern about you, and if they see me too obviously on your side it might be hard for me to cooperate with Italy", "Lol I felt that coming. With the way they were so totally committed west", "In that case we should probably leave France alone to defend against Italy", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s best this season at least. I think we\u2019ll need Italy\u2019s cooperation against turkey/Austria and don\u2019t want them to turn on us too soon", "Ok sounds good.", "So since we're not doing anything in france, what you say we start pushing our armies east? We could hold bel and hol for this turn then in the fall bel>ruh to get ready for a jog through mun in spring and into boh or sil in the following fall", "Also fyi I will need nth to be able to convoy pic unit to nwy.", "Yeah let\u2019s focus east. I\u2019m not exactly sure what Austria is going to do, so let\u2019s take this season to see and go from there", "Cool, thanks for the heads up!", "Question.  Are you into what Italy is doingm", "?", "Idk, seems like they are only going after France right now, which is just pushing France up against us", "I haven\u2019t coordinated with Italy much, just trying to keep communication open. I think Italy is open to cooperate with us against France (obviously) and is trying to keep Austria focused on Russia/turkey", "I'm super busy with work right. I'll get with you soon as I can", "Ok no worries!", "Hey just give me a moveset to enter.  I don't have time to do any discussing :/", "We do need to push east for sure.  As much as possible", "Ok nvm. Already put my orders in. I'm holding bel unless you want me to go to ruh to get that unit through mun in spring to help in the east to lock it down before Turkey does", "gah sorry I missed this earlier! Hope life gets less hectic", "Holding bel sounds good to me", "Would you be ok with me taking Swe so i can get another build this winter? Just thinking we will need more armies against the east. I'm amenable to another flip flop in the future \ud83d\ude42", "Ok will do. I'm very sorry I haven't had much time for you", "Yea I'm good with that. It is paramount to get armies east", "I'm working on getting some in from the north", "Awesome, thanks!", "Anything for you my queen. Even up to half of my kingdom  ;) hehe", "Likewise for you sir!", "Do you know where I got that quote from? Lol", "No... haha sorry. I am guessing it's from a movie?", "Yep :) the movie of queen Esther", "I may just call you my \"Queen Esther\" lol", "Unless you're name is prettier than that?", "I am \"Sir [redacted] the First\" ;)", "Esther is a regal name, I like that", "I haven't heard of that move though haha", "Queen Esther it is ;)", "Perfect \ud83d\ude03", "Hey! Hope work is less busy today! Let me know what you're thinking this season. I'm going to push armies east", "Well still going hard but I can take a min for you Ms. Queen Esther  :)", "ok \ud83d\ude42 nothing very urgent", "Basically my plan is just push east with you", "Just wondering what you think we should do about France in the next few seasons", "Idk, what do you suggest?", "He's pretty tied up with Italy and Italy is tied up with him", "We could take him out or let him keep Italy in check but then again we could use Italy's help against Turkey", "Yeah I'm not sure if it's better to cooperate with Italy and take out france, or just let the two of them fight it out a little longer.  I just wanted to check if you'd make any agreements recently to France", "I haven't talked to him in a season or two", "Just that I would ceasefire on our borders so he could focus on Italy", "Nothing beyond that", "I'm inclined to just cooperate with Italy and take him out. That would be one less loose end. If we do that then we would have Italy's and Austria's help to eliminate Turkey", "Also in about one more year it will be time to start insinuating to Italy and Austria  that we will betray each other after turkey is gone", "Ok, good to know", "Yes, I like both of those plans", "I think it'll be fairly easy to take france out at this point, and Italy seems cooperative and its likely we could each get a supply center if we help", "Would you support me into Moscow? And let me know if you need my support in Bur or anywhere", "(and thanks again for Swe last winter, hopefully we can put some of these new armies to good use)", "Frankly I was expecting to get Moscow since I gave you Sweden", "I wouldn't mind sharing France with you though", "Besides I have 2 armies that I need to put to use in the east. I could get the far eastern fringe of Russia and you would be getting most of Austria.", "Ooo I don't want to count the chicks before they hatch but imaging an English turkey?!!! Austria for you Turkey for me and we share the Balkans or something along those lines", "About support to bur, let me see first if France will reply and accept my offer to help him regain marseilles", "Ok that seems fair. I know we had talked about you just having StP when we originally discussed Russia. The only problem is that Austria is really worried about you at the moment and doesn't want to cooperate or make moves against Turkey when he sees you rolling down russia.", "Italy is spooking everybody about me :/", "So what does Austria want me to do then? Stab you instead of going south to help against Turkey?", "And yes I hear you about our original discussion although we can both testify that a lot has happened since then lol. Always hard to project a concrete future you know", "I think Austria just wants everyone else to stay put except him haha", "Let me ask you my Queen Esther, are you uncomfortable with me having units all around you?", "I could understand such a feeling which is why I'm trying to keep as far away from your borders as possible while simultaneously keeping up with your growth.", "\"Half of the Kingdom\" seems to be coming to fruition sooner than expected hahaha", "Hah yes, I understand too. I suppose I'm feeling a bit undecided on how to deal with Austria at the moment.", "Tell you what. You take Moscow then and  I'll stay in the background like a lion ready to pounce at the right time. You get your leverage on Austria with that and in return you help me get Paris and bre.", "I'm moving into Pru to insinuate to Austria that I'll be trying to move into StP, and hopefully that will be enough to keep him off my back another season or two", "Oops we sent messages at the same time haha", "Or I go to moscow this spring and you ask him to move to ukr to support you into Moscow in the fall.", "The move to pru works with both plans", "Hmm both good ideas. Though it seems unlikely that you wouldn't bounce in Moscow without my support, and if I support you, then the whole rue with Austria is up", "*ruse", "I must admit, I've been in bed with russia too \ud83d\ude2c hehe. He told me himself he would help me get Moscow to keep Turkey from getting it", "Russia was just a \"concubine\" tho lol", "BETTER BE haha", "Ok then, let's go with your second plan", "My dear Esther! I put it on my Kingdom that concubine is all it was lol", "All right second plan it is then", "Well Turkey is very VERY adamant about Moscow being rightfully his", "He just tried to get my support into Moscow too, which I declined", "Good", "Thank you", "What did he say to that?", "I think he\u2019ll move into Ukr instead. So hopefully turkey and Austria will at least bounce there?", "Sweet. Did you tell him that you want Moscow?", "No. He guessed that you and I had plans to split up Russia, but i evaded that part of the convo haha", "That's my queen!!!", "Did you intend to hold everywhere?", "Ah that sux!!! :/ I was in a business meeting!", "I absolutely did not intend to do that!!!", "And france moving on me?!?!? He explicitly said he was not moving against me this season", "\ud83d\ude26", "Mind if I get either Moscow or Sweden? I pretty much need a build in lvp to fight France back", "?", "Hey! Sorry for the delay, was kind of checked out for the weekend haha. Yeah, happy to give back Swe. Would you be ok supporting me into Moscow?", "Thought Austria was supporting you? Turkey gave up on getting Moscow", "But yes I can support you", "Yeah I thought so too, but he hasn\u2019t responded all weekend....so thank you! I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s just offline. I can keep you posted though", "Could you please support ruh>bel?", "I am completely putting my Kingdom in your hands this season lol.", "Support entered!", "Thank you Queen Esther.", "Of course, King", "Ok Austria got back to me and is supporting me into Moscow, so don\u2019t worry about it!", "In that case should go to Moscow as well to show conflict to the other nations?", "Yeah good idea", "Really is to bad that I missed my moves last season.  That would've been awesome ammunition to use against them hehe", "Yeah oh well...I still think we are in good shape for the time being!", "Yea you're right. The Sweden move will also help", "I will definitely look the the bad guy this season \ud83d\udc7a", "Hahah here he comes", "Austria will be excited and happy \ud83d\ude05", "Oh boy. Italy too \ud83d\ude02", "True that!", "Have you heard anything from France?", "He claims he has no interest in fighting me.  I'm like what's with the Belgium disaster?  Haha", "He only mentioned that you wanted Bur, that\u2019s all though. That was last Friday", "I see.  Quite the trickster", "Did you even talk about that with him?", "Only asked him if he'd like for me to go help him get mar back", "When he declined the offer I said ok", "Ahhhh gotcha", "Maybe your lack of action this season will cause him to back off/head back for Italy", "*last season", "Hopefully", "Apologies my queen I had completely discarded the idea that russia might add the support again since he was radio silent", "Glad you got vie at least!!", "That\u2019s ok! I\u2019ll def need your support to Moscow now since Austria is mad at me \ud83d\ude02", "Raging mad or just mad? Haha", "At least passive-aggressive mad haha", "They want to still work with you I imagine?", "Doesn\u2019t seem like it :/", "At least they locked horns with the turkish now!", "I'll dedicate my unit in stp to help you in whatever way you need in the east and in turn could you dedicate one unit to help me smash out this French nuisance?", "Also I did not expect that move into vie so I appreciate my queen being willing to be the \"bad\" guy along with me haha", "Thank you! And yes.\n\nVie was a last minute decision...maybe should have waiting longer to break non aggression with Austria but he made it too tempting", "*should have waited", "Perhaps. But I think you will be fine. With my unit to help you", "Yes I think so too", "Hmm just noticed something tho. If  I get you into mos that would block my unit off from being able to help. Think we may have to swap again?", "Swap where?", "Just want to make sure I understand what you\u2019re thinking", "Like swap Moscow for swe. That way I can use my unit in the east to help you", "Ok gotcha. Works for me. I'll move my fleet back to Swe and let you have Mos", "Cool deal", "France wants me to suggest something for him. Any ideas?", "Leave Bre behind hahaha", "Hmm", "Do you want to leave him alone this season or no?", "Not necessarily but I could to have him go south", "Do you think he\u2019s going to actually do what you suggest?", "Not really. But he might since I have him pinned", "Yeah fingers crossed. I guess if he goes south, it would get you easier access, even in a season or two", "What if I openly make plans with him to stab you if he goes south?", "That might work. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s particularly worried about me or not", "Ok I'll see what happens and keep you posted", "Cool, thank you", "My regal Queen, are you online?", "Yes, briefly. I have to get in the car to drive home soon. What\u2019s up?", "So france will move to ruh and bur", "With 100% trust we can pull off a super cool moveset this year", "Ok, what are you thinking?", "We let france go into ruh in Hopes of getting mun and I force into hol with support and you retreat into kiel. In the fall I move back out of hol and towards France while you support mun with kiel to deny france", "Of course only if you are on board", "I do trust you to follow through with the moves- but seems like I still end up losing Hol (at least for next winter). Is the goal just to keep France occupied so you can get into France from the other side?", "I have to drive now- will be back online as soon as I can!", "No my Queen I  will be leaving hol in the fall", "But I\u2019ll need the Kie unit to support Mun I think \ud83e\udd14", "Precisely. Hence the reason of me moving out of hol on my own in the fall", "Ah! Gotcha.  Ok let\u2019s go for it! I\u2019m in", "Cool deal. Setting my orders as such", "Also could you wait to move into swe until the fall?", "Yeah, guess that\u2019ll make the whole thing look less planned to everyone else. You\u2019re either a genius or an evil genius hah", "Lol you choose ;)", "And yes the idea was to not let the other nations catch on to what we're doing", "Still all good to go with the plan?", "Absolutely my queen!", "Perfect!", "What's it lookin like for you in Vienna?", "Can you support hold my unit in Moscow?", "Actually nvm that. Russia is defending mos", "Oh that\u2019s good. Austria is definitely after Vie, but I can\u2019t tell if Italy will support them there (so Austria could try to get Turkeys support into War) or if he\u2019ll use both Gal and Bud for Vie", "I get the impression that Austria and Turkey have worked together and against each other off and on, so it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on", "Woooooo *high five*", "High five back ;)", "Were you holding your breath my dear? Hehe", "Maybe a bit haha. It\u2019s all good now \ud83d\ude42", "Hehe, I totally understand", "My queen, I hope you had a great weekend", "Could you do me a favor and bounce with me in nth? Also I propose that we eliminate France Austria and Turkey and draw with Italy", "I'm getting bored and the only way left to spice things up would be to stab you which I'll kill myself before doing. So let's wrap this burrito up. Whatcha say?", "Hey again! Hope you had a good weekend too. Yeah I can bounce you in Nth. I\u2019m cool with the plan to draw with Italy. Seems like Austria and France will be done with easily, hopefully Turkey too", "Awesome! Thank you very much :)\nAnd yes I had a splendid weekend which I topped off with taking my little family kayaking yesterday  ;)", "Fun! I went kayaking last weekend actually, good choice", "In a river or lake? Both are fun depending if you want chill and relax or fast and adventurous :)", "Also I need your support in bel please", "River!", "And will do", "Thank you much my dear!!", "No problem!", "Italy asked about you, so I told them about plans to three-way tie. They are on board!", "Wanna hop into Nth in preparation of a sexy convoy into Syria from Edinburgh?", "Oh man. Yeah I can do that", "Awesome!!", "This game WILL be interesting yet haha", "To my Dear and Loyal Queen Esther. \nRespectfully from yours truly:  (I, King Shetan personally write this note \"Esther First Queen of England and Ruler of the germans.\") I hereby request  that my beautiful foreign Queens would lovingly allow their benevolent \"King Shetan The 1st\" to close out his empire at 12 scs and in Kingly fashion  generously bequeathing 11 scs to each Queen. (Not sure if that ends with a question mark or an exclamation point haha) whew. I'm glad I'm not actually a king. Would be exhausting to always \"try\" to speak with eloquent fluidity", "The edit is my attempt at doing justice to \"Her Majesty\"", "Are you ok?", "Sorry for the delayed response- yes! I appreciate the formal message haha. I\u2019m in agreement; looking forward to getting France, Austria, and Turkey out of our way and wrapping this thing up!", "Haha glad you liked it ;) and thank you", "Do you have any ideas about  how to handle Turkey? I\u2019d like to get into Ukr to start making that push but I\u2019m trying to think of a strategy where Turkey doesn\u2019t end up in Moscow \ud83e\udd14", "Also Italy wants to discuss how we\u2019ll split up the rest of the board. I wish we could all just have a three way convo at this point haha", "I'll support hold Moscow and moscow will support you to ukr. Also I'll ask the if we can get a  group chat for us", "Ok thanks! I doubt we\u2019ll be allowed because of the study but worth asking", "Am I supporting war or gal into ukr?", "Gal", "Thanks for checking!!", "Ok got it", "Yea I'm glad I did lol cuz I first set it for war", "Yeah sorry I didn\u2019t specify before. I guess you can\u2019t read my mind \ud83d\ude06", "Yea sadly there's limits to our connection :/ hehe", "Can you please support Ukr - Sev?", "Already done my Queen", "Danke", "Anything for you my Esther ;)", "Whenever you got a minute let me know", "Hey I\u2019m on line now", "Oh hi :)", "So I have an idea that involve yours truly and this 2 Queens coordinating in perfect harmony to bring the fantasy to fruition. Figured what better way to consummate the marriage of this 3-way union right ;)", "It involves 2 of your fleets 3 of mine and 4 of Her Majesty Queen Bianca De Medici.", "Hahah what\u2019s the idea? Italy and I were going to coordinate to get me into Ank, and then you can take Bre and wrap things up. Sounds like we only have two more moves", "This spring turn I would put a fleet in NAO and NTH while you move NTH into NRG and SWE into SKA. My army in nwy goes to swe and in the fall turn it convoys across a body of 9 fleets all the way around the world into Syria!!!!", "Oh wow I guess we could do that...let me know if Italy is on board too. We can check with the admin, but it seems like the game is ending winter 1910? In which case your army in Syria won\u2019t be doing anything. But I guess this might be a once in a lifetime chance haha", "Keep me posted on what Italy says!", "Yea she's on board", "Cool cool", "Let\u2019s do it", "Exciting!! My moves are already in", "Wooo going to be a party!", "Yes ma'am!! Finish this with an epic bang!! A new big bang theory  haha", "drumroll for the epic convoy", ":)", "How\u2019s it down in the Middle East?? \n\nI set it to 3 way draw for the final season", "Mine is set to 3 way draw as well"],

Could I perhaps just get an agreement from you not to block me moving to Ukraine?", "Ok, that\u2019s what it seemed like. I can agree to that!", "Are you still interested in Moscow?", "oh yes. Why do you ask?", "...If there's any chance you could cut support from Livonia, it'd be greatly appreciated!", "Gah never mind, I was thinking about proposing as such but I think I\u2019ll need the units elsewhere. Let\u2019s stay in touch though- let me know if you\u2019re ever open to coordinating to control the growth of Austria and/or England in the east", "I am open to both of those!

It seems like Austria is solely focused on slowing down Italy at this point. I suspect you could get Rum this season?", "So. Aaaaany chance you're ready to help me stand up to England? If nothing else, I think it'd be a good way for us to build up trust so that we can take on the rising Italy threat once Austria's dealt with.", "I can\u2019t this turn but I definitely want to work together.

I'm not going out without payback.", "any thoughts on the matter?", "whatever im proceeding as if you're with m", "disbanding Gal, i'll support you full into Bul the from there on out we can push Italy out of my territory until my inevitable demise.", "Hey sorry for the delay in getting back to you\u2014Italy has promised me Bul but I appreciate your support in case they are lying", "well they betrayed me so your betrayal is just around the corner.", "I want to see the streets run red with their Ragu and break their spaghetti bones.", "I think that seems likely. \nAnd revenge sure brings out your poetic side! \n...you know that\u2019s kind of how I felt about you when you stabbed me after working with me for several turns.", "Once again, never stabbed you. We never had an agreement for anything other than non-aggression until Russia was dealt with.", "Well you aggressed and Russia was not dealt with", "Believe me or not, but I held out on attacking you as long as a I could and i think that's why italy turned on me.", "I aggressed to keep Italy off of me for all the good it did.", "Any chance you think germany would turn to your cause?", "They have more manpower to take down italy than I do", "I'm asking them if they want to help.", "Germany said they're in, but sounds reluctant to attack directly. So I'm not sure if they're actually committed to anything or if its just another ruse.", "What's the word bird?", "Sorry for the delay\u2014tell me how I can help. Is there any chance you\u2019d willingly let me into rum this season?", "Think of it as you helping yourself really. If you support my push from Rum into Bul you can just move in and take Rum in the same turn, then we can do the same maneuver next season to greece hopefully.", "Not sure how you feel about Germany, but I think they're still working with Italy. I asked them for some help and they gave excuses so I'm expecting them to move from the North on me this sesason. If they don't it will be a pleasant surprise. Just a heads up for what's coming though.", "For clarification. You support Rum into Bul, and move either Ukr or Sev into Rum. Next season you support Bul into Gre and move something else into Bul. You get Italy out of your hair and stick it back to them. If Germany actually helps then I continue to push and you follow my units, if they don't then I hold off and you take my territory. Noble last stand and all that noise.", "Okay thanks for clarifying. I just placed the order", "I support you from Rum into Bud and you support from Bul into Gre? Then you move into next round to prevent Italy from gaining units?", "Also open to suggestions, just realized that right now there isn't a lot that stops Italy from getting production.", "I don\u2019t have a unit that can reach greece to support you there?", "Just noticed that as well.", "I think you should try for serbia into tripoli because italy confirmed that they\u2019re attacking serbia with albania", "Okay, then do you want to support Bul into Ser and you can move Con into Bul if you choose?", "I\u2019m a little hesitant to piss off italy, to be honest.", "They were pretty upset about last season and I only just barely smoothed it over", "Well, you can either piss them off and have them attack you or you can be nice and have them attack you. Only one of them ends with you gaining something out of it.", "That\u2019s...a very good point", "\"I'm obviously fairly heavily committed to my attack on you at the moment, but I do consider Turkey's shenanigans around Bulgaria a breach so before I forgive and forget I thought I'd offer you a chance to negotiate.\"", "Yeah seems like it was really smoothed over.", "Ah, okay.\n...So what did you say to Italy?", "\"at least when my people die they'll die knowing they honored their alliance. Have fun under the boots of england.\"", "That\u2019s pretty good.\nAlright, i\u2019m moving into bul and I\u2019ll support you into ser", "Word, I'll put the moves in.", "I think I'm going to disband at Vie, I can use my other two units to support you into Ser or support with one at Gre and one at Bud.", "I think it'd help me more if you dissolve Albania, and hit Ser and Bud to cut support so that Italy can't take Rum or Bul. \n\nI really will support you into Bud this spring if you want; I'm sorry I didn't follow through on support for you last night but at like 11:30 when I finalized my orders I ultimately decided I'd need another fleet (and therefore a guaranteed build in Bul) to protect from Italy.", "Word, I'm boarding a flight now so I wont be able to place orders until later. Not really sure that support would stop me from dying anyway so I'm pretty indifferent as long as Italy loses.", "I know it's late notice, but could you poke greece to cut support of Bul?", "Sorry for not responding or doing anything.

I'm really surprised you ended up in Sweden", "We're sorting things out. Or trying to. They had broken a dmz treaty the first  year so forced my hand a bit. But we'll see what comes of it.", "So do I take it you've lost interest in invading Russia for the time being?", "Yea well catching wind of France's  betrayal took the wind out of me lol. Let me deal with this threat real quick first", "But seems you got him... more than handled lol", "I do hope so...", "It's funny how your \"allies\" keep \"betraying\" you yet you seem to be the one who keeps getting dots... \ud83d\ude1b", "Yea that is weird", "I did have a falling out with Germany  but I'm  working  it out with them and I will  make it up to them", "I'm impressed you wheedled a support out of Russia last fall. You're full of surprises! So, are you and Italy collaborating to take down France?", "Honestly I feel like I no longer no what's going on lol", "But yes I  think that's the plan.  If Italy doesn't have death in mind for me", "Hey man you online?", "What are we doing about Moscow? \nMust admit I want it", "Well if you try to take it I must admit i\u2019ll be...difficult", "I'd like to come to some sort of understanding about it", "What level of difficult are we talking and in what way?", "Understand this: I've been hammering away at Russia while you've been running around in the west and the Atlantic. I will do everything I can to make Moscow mine.", "Yea I suck at playing hard ball so do what you feel you deserve. And yes you're right. You've been hammering away at Russia and with Austria's help been very successful.", "I'll give you that for sure", "Well fyi I'm going for Moscow so do with that as you see fit", "Oh wow I'm rereading our messages this morning (good morning btw) and wow do I sound horrible!! Long and hard day at work trying to unite my fellow contractors and stop bitchiness amongst us, seems to have leaked into here :/ I'm sorry", "Also kinda got on my high horse with what you said about me but you're totally right I've just been kinda gallivanting around aimlessly. I do have a lot to learn, it's not like I do in depth studies on how to play DIPLOMACY or anything I just like to make a party out of it and have a good time lol. But I can see I can learn from you. Again sorry about how nasty I sounded", "That\u2019s alright I prefer honest nastiness to dishonest courtesy", "Haha very true!", "Which makes honest courtesy the ideal world in which case I would ask that you consider making an exception with Moscow for me as that would keep our borders very simple", "Our borders are simple now. You have countless avenues for expansion. France, for instance.", "I take it you have already made a deal with Germany and Austria for mos?", "I've made arrangements that factor in Russia working with you, but I'm not going to say more.", "Hmm that's interesting", "Clearly don't need your snark right now, England! I figure there's no sense fighting you over Moscow now that I've got other things to deal with, so it's yours next season as far as I'm concerned.", "Ok thank you. And seems you won't have to take anymore of my snark for a good long while as I obviously have my own problems to deal with now too.", "Eh, you were stretching yourself too thin trying to get a foothold in France *and* russia, I think. But you'll survive!", "Yea I did make a blunder back there.

{"messages": ["Hello Germany, nice to make your acquaintance. \n\nI've been thinking about this game alot, because the fact that it will only last until 1910 really changes my strategy. Add in that no one is likely to NMR and I believe it will be near impossible to solo. \n\nNormally when playing Russia I try to grab a couple German centers around 1904, allowing me to hold over the stalemate line setting up a solo when I conquer the East. Since I'm not intending to solo in this game, however, it doesn't make sense to go after your centers. It would be much better for both of us, I believe, to agree to a pact of non aggression. I could even offer some help against England, if there came a time when you wished that. What do you think?", "Interesting points.  I've been thinking about how the format and time limitation might change the game as well.\n\nFor transparency, England reached out to me as well, and generally I think Germany working with England is, in a vacuum, the best course.\n\nI'm fine with a non-aggression pact, but we need to set pretty clear ground rules - I'm significantly more vulnerable than you.  Interested in each of us setting up a proposal, and see how well they match?", "How about a commitment to something like the following through Spring 2003.  We can revisit or extend from there, and of course any of these are subject to specific agreement otherwise:\n\n- Total DMZ in SIL & PRU\n- No German units in BoT or LVN\n- Germany concedes Sweden, but only to be occupied by fleets.\n- No Russian units in BAL\n- No army builds in Berlin\n- No army builds in StP\n- Notify before a build in WAR\n\nWhat do you think?", "I agree to all of those points.\n\nJust to be clear, England is not necessarily a target of mine, but if necessary I can act as an insurance policy against English aggression for you.", "By the way, for whatever it's worth I am hearing talk coming back to me that you are looking to open north.  Again, it's spring '01, so talk is pretty cheap.  But just thought I'd flag it for you.", "Talk is cheap, and after Spring resolution you will see that I fully intend to abide by our agreement. \n\nThe fact that you brought this up with me really builds trust with me. I did tell Austria that I was heading North West, but obviously that is a lie. I hope that you see it to be in your best interest to keep that confidential because I truly do intend to work with you all the way through 1910.", "Well, what do you think about how the spring went?  Looks like it couldn't have gone too much better for you.  You have the drop on BOTH Austria and Turkey.\n\n...which makes me think you don't.  You strike me as too good a player to not understand that opening heavy against both of them forces them to join forces, which means a nasty stalemate.  Therefore, I'm smelling a slingshot.\n\nSo...Con-AEG and A Bul S a Russian BLA C A Ank-Rum?  Or maybe support from Ukraine while Bul takes a shot at Greece?  Are you and Italy going to coordinate moves so you don't bounce each other?", "Sorry, I missed your message, it's been a wild week at work.\n\nI hesitate to give away too much detail, but I will be very clear in stating that I intend to focus on my Southern sphere of influence for the foreseeable future. \n\nIt does look like you and England will likely have France cornered by 1902. England doesn't really have any where to go after that happens other than your centers and a few of mine. I just want you to know that it's critical for my sgame to have you holding back any threats coming in from the North, and I'll offer you any support that I have available in the North when necessary.", "It was a very nice open for you.", "It seems you'll have to focus South, what with the clear Lucy-pulling-the-football-away-from-Charlie-Brown that just occurred at the Black Sea.\n\nWhere do you plan to build?  We agreed no builds in Warsaw, and no armies in StP.  So it seems you should have a second fleet in the north to help with England?  Unless you're planning to defer.", "I had toyed with asking permission for Warsaw, but after evaluating more it will be Moscow, F NC StP and Sevastopol. \n\nAnd yeah the South is chaos right now, but it's controlled chaos.", "Well, we've been more or less jockeying for position, huh?  I hate to do this, but I want to give you a heads up that I have to break our agreement and end our NAP a season early.  It's not what I planned or intended, but right now this game will turn either way on a dime.  You played the beginning of the game beautifully, but gained so much so fast that you not only forced Austria and Turkey into an alliance, but England and I as well.  So much so that we let France up off the mat, too.\n\n...and I kinda hate you for that because I really hate allying with England as Germany, and I had France absolutely wrecked.\n\nI expect to enjoy playing this out with you either way.  And I'm fascinated to see how this fall goes in the Southeast.  What a tangled mess, both the tactics and the diplomacy!\n\nBest,\n- Kaiser", "I appreciate the honesty. I would like to propose an alternative. Use this turn to get the drop on England, then you, Turkey and I can take this all the way to a three way draw in 1910. Turkey and I have been working together closely since the opening move, but we've covered it well. Turkey has the remnants of Austria and Italy to fight, and you have the West to conquer. I can help you both without putting myself close to a solo. I've shown myself to be a trustworthy Ally to you and I truly mean it when I say that I want us to have the lions share of the spoils in 1910. A three way alliance between you, Turkey and I makes perfect sense strategically.", "So, I don't think that's going to happen.\n\nI recognize the risk I run with all allies at my back, but such is the life of the Kaiser who does not eliminate at least one of France or England.\n\nI choose to play this game with much more trust than most.  In this particular case I don't have a ton of choice in the matter.", "Your Ally isn't going to be much help if they fail to enter orders. I can support you into Sweden this Fall in exchange for some minor concessions. We could probably even get you into the North Sea simultaneously.", "I can't believe you didn't sniff out the Livonia convoy.  I was figuring it was a <50% chance of going through.  Or maybe it's what you wanted me to do?!?!", "I was more concerned with losing Norway, to be honest. I've kind of retreated into a posture that's more defensive than it probably should be, but if you and England are going to present a United front I really can't do anything else, except to hope that A) you reconsider your alliances or B) England decides to stab you (my least preferred option)", "I'd like to present another thought for you. Let's assume that you and England continue to push against me, and Turkey begins to wrap up Italy (quite possible considering that Turkey is likely to get into the Ionian this turn). \n\nBecause I must move all units Northward to defend against E/G, I'm absolutely forced to leave my Southern border undefended. If Turkey grows to 12 or 13 centers they could easily roll up my Southern Centers and solo this whole thing.\n\nI hope I'm not coming off as beating a dead horse here, but it makes so much sense for us to be aligned. \n\n1) A G/R/T Alliance can be easily balanced until 1910. \n2) I am already positioned to help you against England.\n3) England's NMR means they are an unstable Ally for you, but might make it easy for you to gain their centers quickly.\n4) Forcing me to defend in the North invites a Turkish solo.\n5) I have already proven myself to be a trustworthy ally by abiding the agreement set forth at the beginning of the game.\n\nI enjoy playing with you, and I really desperately want to work with you, for game and for personal reasons.", "You can't reasonably have had hope to keep Norway through the year under almost any circumstances.  Even, as it turns out, with an England NMR.\n\nYou're fundamentally correct, and Italy is a wild card in this thing for sure.  And I would enjoy playing this one out with you as well.  But it might have to be smack talk.\n\nIf you're concerned about a potential continental Caliphate, show me.  Support Tyr-Tri.  I'm not saying I'm going to make that move - I might - but I'll take it as a strong sign that you're serious about us working together, and about the Turkish threat.", "That was a very rough turn for you. If you want to negotiate I'm open, I could make things easier for you in the South in exchange for help against England in the North.", "It was a rough turn for both of us, I think.  Given my current situation, there isn't a worse possible play for me than antagonizing England... assuming he's not already aligned with France.  He's made no move to show me that he is or isn't.\n\nWhat I can do is work to make England see that if France can't be trusted, trying to force his way in through StP is a death sentence: growth will be too slow, France will have to circle back for him, and his forces will be committed to that logjam in the Northeast.\n\nI should be able to convince him to convoy to Belgium, and that's his only army.  Should give you plenty of breathing room.  I'll try to convince him to focus on France.  Self-serving, but probably in his best interests anyway.\n\nI'll be in touch.", "I just wrote the following to England:", "So that was interesting.  I'm actually not that bad off as long as France and Russia aren't coordinating, and more importantly, as long as you aren't with France.\n\nSince clearly France can't be trusted, and obviously he'll have to come for you at some point to go for the win, maybe a convoy to Belgium is in order?  You can hold StP easily, get 2 builds, prevent France from getting any, and change the balance of power pretty dramatically.\n\nIf you really trust France you could also convoy to Holland and take a stab at crippling me permanently - he'll get +1 or +2, you'll get +2.  Though you risk bouncing with France if he gets greedy.  But if he builds, and you see a F Mar, you're in for a rough go.  If it's me, convoy to Belgium is the smarter play.  I don't even see it as a stab on your end - our alliance was three-way, and it is broken.  If you weren't in on it, it's broken for all of us.", "(pt 2:)\nIn either case, it's probably not a great idea to try to force your way into Russia via StP.  You've got it, and can hold it easily - there's a reason it's part of the stalemate lines.  You need to grow as fast as you can, or you're just waiting for a knife.  I was waiting for Turkey to stab Russia to give you an opening.  It didn't come, so I tried to force it and opened myself.  But if Turkey stabs now he'll collapse too quickly for you to get (or at least get with any chance to defend) more than one more center.\n\nI would strongly consider figuring out lines and conditions with Russia so you can both dedicate your forces elsewhere.  And I say that knowing that a highly likely place for Russia to dedicate forces is at me.  But since the second most likely (and possibly first) is at Turkey, which takes a partner from France, it's worth the risk.\n\nWhat's on your mind?", "(wrap up:)\nAs I look at what I just wrote, I am going to cut/paste it to Russia to facilitate discussions among the three of us.", "So, by \"on France's side\" you mean \"supporting yourself into Tyrolia,\" right?", "Naw, it's too late.

{"messages": ["Would you like to work together?", "Depends on what you're thinking.  As Germany, I think England makes the most sense as an ally.

Which is the other reason I'm suggesting that you take Sweden - just in case Belgium.", "Just updated & saved:\nF BAL S SKA - Swe\nF HEL - Den\nA Kie S HEL - Den\nA Ruh - Mun\nA Tyr - Tri\n\nAs long as you bump Norway and move Hel-Swe, we should be good.", "Alright, sounds good.", "Russia is reaching out to me about turning on you.  I assume the reverse is also true.  Don't buy it.\n\nThe reality is that he's totally on the ropes right now.  Scandinavia is lost to him, and with France and I starting to pressure Italy and Austria about done, Turkey is already matching his 7 centers and in a much better position both to grow and to stab.\n\nI misread the Turkey relationship - alarm bells were going off, but that was a helluva lot of trust for a game that is (supposedly?) blind.  Given that I'm not confident that it *is* blind, we have to assume that they're acting as one power.\n\nAll of which is just a mush of thoughts, but I want to pass them to France as well to spur discussion.  I don't want him to feel left out and get antsy.  Especially when he has to build at Brest.", "Russia actually hasn't spoken to me. Not since the beginning of the game.", "Ideas on what I should build? I'm thinking fleet in edi.", "Okay, so this year we need to lock Norway down, ideally with a British army, make sure France is fully on board, figure out what's up with Italy, and penetrate east.\n\nI think the clearest thing is that you take Norway in the Spring, and from Sweden.  He can't stop it, and with my Den-SKA he's left only with a retreat to BAL.\n\nYou'd then need to get the army in there in the fall.  We position in the spring and do the same with a convoy in the fall as well.  But to do that you need to stay in Sweden, which isn't a good use of a fleet - as it stands, Italy can legitimately be in the channel by winter.", "Alright, I'll attack nwy with swe and support from my fleets. Next phase I can convoy from Bel.", "If you can, I think you should move to ska so that his unit gets destroyed.", "I'm moving to SKA, but my guess is that he'll retreat to BAL.  He might disband anyway, but I doubt it.", "F BAL C Kie - Lvn\nF Den - SKA\nA Kie - Lvn\nA Mun - Sil\nA Tyr S Mar - Pie", "You are there, right?  I get that it didn't affect much that you hung out on your party barges near the North Pole, but we really need that convoy to Norway, along with vacating Sweden.\n\nAre we good?", "I entered my orders and made sure I updated them. I'm not entirely sure what happened. I'll convoy this phase.", "Okay.  I'm taking Sweden, though.\n\nMaybe we sell it as a stab?  I'll bump StP, or take it if he gives up on Norway and moves that army.", "France needs a build.  How do you feel about giving up Belgium? we", "F BAL - Swe\n\nA Lvn - Stp\n\nA Mun - Sil\n\nF SKA S BAL - Swe\n\nA Tyr S Pie - Ven", "...unless I hear otherwise.", "Sounds good", "Sweden is yours next year - apologies for the miscalculation.\n\nIt will be interesting to see where Russia disbands.  He either is open to one of us, or just *begging* for Turkey to smell the solk and stab.", "I was thinking something like:\nF Fin - Stp/sc\nF NTH - Nwy\nF NWG - BAR\nA Nwy S Fin - Stp/sc\n\nGermany:\nA Lvn - Mos\nA Mun/Ber ?\nA Sil - Gal\nF SKA - Den\nF Swe - BOT\nA Tyr S Mun - Boh\n\nThis gets a fleet into StP instead of an army, but it's a lock rather than a hope.  I'd leave Sweden in the fall if that move doesn't succeed...and start scrambling to protect my home centers.\n\nWhat do you think?", "That sounds good to me!", "No, I think that's broken because of the disband and build.  I'll give it some thought, and I'd welcome your thoughts.", "Well, I like the moves you have for me, except the f nth - nwy, that would disrupt my attack, so I was thinking f nth s nwy.  I also like the moves you gave planned out for yourself. So whatever you want to change, let me know what you're doing and I'll tell you what I think.", "So that was interesting.  I'm actually not that bad off as long as France and Russia aren't coordinating, and more importantly, as long as you aren't with France.\n\nSince clearly France can't be trusted, and obviously he'll have to come for you at some point to go for the win, maybe a convoy to Belgium is in order?  You can hold StP easily, get 2 builds, prevent France from getting any, and change the balance of power pretty dramatically.\n\nIf you really trust France you could also convoy to Holland and take a stab at crippling me permanently - he'll get +1 or +2, you'll get +2.  Though you risk bouncing with France if he gets greedy.  But if he builds, and you see a F Mar, you're in for a rough go.  If it's me, convoy to Belgium is the smarter play.  I don't even see it as a stab on your end - our alliance was three-way, and it is broken.  If you weren't in on it, it's broken for all of us.", "In either case, it's probably not a great idea to try to force your way into Russia via StP.  You've got it, and can hold it easily - there's a reason it's part of the stalemate lines.  You need to grow as fast as you can, or you're just waiting for a knife.  I was waiting for Turkey to stab Russia to give you an opening.  It didn't come, so I tried to force it and opened myself.  But if Turkey stabs now he'll collapse too quickly for you to get (or at least get with any chance to defend) more than one more center.\n\nI would strongly consider figuring out lines and conditions with Russia so you can both dedicate your forces elsewhere.  And I say that knowing that a highly likely place for Russia to dedicate forces is at me.  But since the second most likely (and possibly first) is at Turkey, which takes a partner from France, it's worth the risk.\n\nWhat's on your mind?", "As I look at what I just wrote, I am going to cut/paste it to Russia to facilitate discussions among the three of us.", "Are you still willing to work together? I never intended to use you as a meatshield, and hoped to remain allies with you to the end. Once I have Scandinavia locked down (which should be shortly) I will begin to redirect forces to assist you against France.", "I've got no problem with that.  I can make things tricky for awhile, I think.  I haven't actually looked at the adjudication, though.", "So, can we agree that we all need to put everything aside and stop Turkey?  He's 3 away from the solo...\n\nI know I can't do much, but I can support y'all as needed and do whatever else I can.\n\n(Sending to all remaining powers that aren't Turkey)", "Yes, that's the case", "I'm moving lvn to pru. You should support this move, as well as defend yourself in bur. This is to help prevent the ottoman advance.", "I was thinking A Ber - Sil\nF Kie - BAL\n\nwith\n\nF BAL - BOT\nF Nwy - Stp/nc\nF Pru S Stp - Lvn\nA Stp - Lvn\n\nand\n\nA Hol - Ruh\nA Mun - Boh\nA Pie - Tyr\nF Tun S TYS - ION\nA Tus - Rom\nF TYS - ION\n\nI think Munich is safe no matter what happens (except if he vacates Bohemia).\nSt Petersburg is most likely locked down.\nHe expects you to move to Venice.  My guess is that he'll support himself on.  Let him.  You'll either slide into Rome or stop his fleet from doing the same.\nYour fleet in TYS is protected.\nI get to build an army, which should be the nail in the coffin of his chances to take a centre north of Switzerland.\n\nThoughts?", "That sounds good to me", "Can you defend Prussia?", "Bal defend bur and all else defend min?", "Mun*", "Works for me.  I was hoping to get Munich back to close the game out, but...", "You could talk to France about that, but it doesn't really matter.

That hurts.  And Austria is in no position to provide much help.\n\nWhat's the plan from this point?", "My hands are tied with my positioning and an NAP that runs through the end of this year, but I'm happy to work as an intermediary with you and Austria to help coordinate.\n\nI've given you one bit of help - Russia can't build in Warsaw, so it takes one unit out of the South.", "Ugh, what a pain in the ass. I can't even rotate on him in a meaningful time frame, and Austria's going to be no help any time soon beyond protecting Bulgaria this turn.", "You could take him down together, unless he's working with Italy.  Even if he's not, Italy's going to feed on Austria - he's pretty committed - and come after you since you're exposed.  The upside is just that they wouldn't likely be explicitly helping each other.\n\nI don't have anything preventing me from going at Italy, and he's really wrecking everything right now.

It's frustrating. \nIf I make it through this turn, should be all good, though. Looks like y'all have Russia pretty well stopped in the North", "I'm sandboxing the mess you guys have down there.  Here's the thing: Russia is going to add a center in the north, and he can't get a build.  So y'all need to have him net no better than -1 down there.  Since we have to assume he's going to take Ankara, you need to take two centers in Austria/Balkans.\n\nI think I have a solution, but I need to stress test.  It will need my Tyr for sure.

All that is true.\n\nHey, speaking of ballooning out to monster size, you had a nice year.\n\n...just sayin'.", "Since you're on to Italy anyway, any chance you want to take Trieste?", "I did, but that will is almost dry. And, yes, I'm happy to take Trieste. Given the current positions, if nothing else changes, at most I get one Italian for after that, so next build (Trieste?) Is probably time to turn North.

{"messages": ["Good morning, France.\n\nI wanted to reach out to you to see where your mind is at initially.  I also wanted to let you know up front that, unless something changes, I will be moving to Ruhr.  I'm not worrying about Belgium at this point, but I do want to ensure that I have Holland locked down.  Most importantly, this isn't intended as hostility towards you.\n\nWith that out of the way, what's going on so far?  Have you heard from Italy, England, or Russia?  What are you hoping for early?", "Checking back in with one more question: would you prefer to plan a stand-off in Burgundy?  I'm not excited about it, but I'm open to it.", "Hi Germany! \n\nBounce in Burgundy sounds good. But your move to Ruh... idk, not really liking that. Holland is guaranteed to you winter 1901 no matter if you have Ruh or not. The main reason you would move it there in 1901 would be to take Belgium, and then move in on me. It feels pretty anti-france. Hopefully we can work something out, and maybe even arrange an alliance against England? About that, have you heard anything from them? I havn't. \n\nLooking forwards to a good game! -France", "Yes, England reached out to me, and asked if I was interested in an alliance of the three of us.  I told him I wasn't, as that rarely ends well for Germany.  I told him I was definitely interested in allying with one of you, but not both.\n\nI'm not a big fan of a bounce in Burgundy.  It's kind of a fear maneuver that puts both of us behind overall.  It's nice on your end, since it functions as your defense and frees up Marsailles.\n\nSpeaking of Marsailles - nothing from Italy?  I haven't heard from him yet.", "What would the rest of S01 look like with the Burgundy bounce?", "So... what are you going to do about ruhr? The rest of S01 really depends on where we want this to go. Do you want a full on alliance against england or just an agreement of DMZs and who gets what territories.", "Nothing from italy...", "If you don't want to do a bounce where would munich go? I'm planning on moving to burgundy, because I don't really have anywhere to move it in the spring, and I don't 100% trust you.", "It's probably best that you don't 100% trust me.  That's kind of the game we play - we trust those we shouldn't, and doubt those we should trust.\n\nI'm moving to Ruhr, which isn't considered to be anti-France generally.  Holland isn't garaunteed to me unless I pass on Denmark.  Moving to the Ruhr (or successfully to Burgundy, which I assume you wouldn't like) is the only way to ensure Holland without F-Kie-Hol.  If you're moving to Burgundy that will pretty much cast the die, I guess.\n\nHonestly, if you haven't heard from Italy you might take that as a cue to be nervous.  He has every reason to want to come to an agreement with you.\n\nYou still haven't heard from England either?", "Enland isn't talking that much. They have communicated to me about an alliance with you, but I feel like they arn't that involved in this game and wouldn't be a good ally. For this reason I think we should work together to take them out", "I thought you were going to bounce me... oh well. I know I'm in Bur rn and that is generally considered an  anti-german position, but I don't really want to fight you, since I have my hands full w/ England.  Do you want to try to take out England? I could support Ruh into belgium if you were willing to support me sometime in the future", "I said I was moving to Ruhr.  How could I have moved to Burgundy as well?  Not only did I say I was moving to Ruhr, I said that it wasn't considered to be an anti-Frencb move, and that if you moved to Burgundy, the die would be cast.\n\nI'm a little surprised that was somehow unclear...", "Look, I opened the game gunning for you, which was nothing more than a strategic choice.  I actually was kind of bummed about it - you seem more into the game and more talkative, both of which I like.\n\nBut things change.  Looking around, Russia - with whom I have a NAP expiring in the fall - is about to crush Austria and Turkey at once, which will makd him essentially unstoppable.  Based on the build in the Irish Sea, England is certainly not preparing to box him in up North, never mind pressure him.  He may be working with him.  As far as I can tell, Italy isn't talking to anyone, but jumped on Austria as well.  I need Austria to provide some resistance at the very least, and so do you.  You run the risk of losing without ever engaging with your conqueror.  To me, that's always the worst way to lose.", "Let's talk, and soon.  You got a build, and still have Spain there for a second.  If we can make peace, you can dig in.\n\nItaly is the key to this, IMO.", "Ok", "I\u2019m busy but can we work this out in like a few hours", "Sure.", "Ah! So close to adjudication. Ok are you there?", "Turns out yes, but not for too long", "I agree that we need to stop Russia. I can't really directly contact him much but I will reach out to England/Austria/Italy.", "Okay...\n\nAnything else?", "Well, what are you going to do?", "Germany... I understand you want me to help with this russia thing but the truth is your a lot closer to russia than I am and frankly I can't completely trust that you won't attack me'", "That's what I'm trying to figure out.  What I want to do is move to Tyrolia, you move to Marsailles and the Piedmont, and we make sure Britain can't stay on the continent.\n\nBut my default course, since we haven't been able to connect, is to come at you hard and make sure I get my builds on my back door.", "...tough spot.", "Well, I would like that as well. But it definitly requires an element of trust.", "Agreed.  My plan and my order set was to attack you.  It's the most obvious course.", "Are you going to?", "Let me ask you.  Assume my moves were tactical, and that the strategically correct thing is to walk away right now.\n\nBig leap of faith for both, but especially for you.\n\nThat said, look back and you'll see that I've done nothing but deal straight with you.", "Tell me you're in, and that you'll move Bur-Mar (then to Pie) and I'll believe you, make the leap of faith, and order Mun-Tyr.  Support me in Belgium in case England double crosses.  I'll move to the North Sea.", "I'm willing to do it; of course it probably isn't a good move in the short term, as I don't completely trust you... but nobody is going to win in the short term, either. So yes, I would do it. But I can't support you in belgiam since I'm moving Bur... but anyways, I actually think you should work with englnad and let them move to Bel, where they could convoy away next turn to Nwy which would really be a pain for russia(which would be good for us)", "Your going to have to talk to england about that last part, I told them and they said they were on board but you guys need to work it out", "He already reached out to me.   Working on it.", "Cut/paste:", "A Bel - Ruh\n\nA Ber - Kie\n\nF Hol - HEL\n\nF Kie - BAL\n\nA Mun - Tyr", "ok", "...and you'll support my move back to Belgium in the fall from Picardy?", "So you want me to move to Pic?", "Where's holland going?", "But yes, I will support you back into Bel", "HELgoland Bight.", "Hmm. So i'm assuming that means Eng-Nth, for the convoy, right", "Bal isn't the best spot...", "But not really that many other options.", "I think that's the idea, yes.  He floated popping his A Pic, but that puts us way behind.", "Bal is perfect.  Fall is A Kie-Den, the. A Den-Livonia.", "The army in Nwy will be amazing \ud83d\ude0d if it works", "Ok. But it's going to trigger alarms for Russia. You don't have to do it right away.", "Russia might try for Den this turn", "Right.  That's Spring '03.  It's pretty late for dancing around.  Look at Austria and Turkey.  They're toast.", "I can take Den back.  I have three units on it.", "Ok, sure", "Well, I hope all goes well.", "England says he's placing orders now.  Mine are placed/saved.\n\nYeah, me too.  *Gulp*", "Ooh, got a message from austria. Says russia isn't talking and turkey is working w/ russia", "Turkey isn't.  Just got bit on a fake slingshot Juggernaut.  See the convoy across the black sea that didn't happen?", "Sry. Meant italy is working w/ russia", "typo", "This worked out good.", "Italy helped austria get russia", "Oh.  I suspected that, but couldn't get my hands around it.  Austria told me that he suspected, but had no evidence.  I haven't heard from Italy at all, and everyone has said the same to me.", "Yup.  Okay, gotta run now.", "Same here. Italy is mute. Looks like I won't be getting Spain either", "Ok. Nice work. Talk tmrow", "Why are you not getting Spain?  A Mar S MAO-Spa/sc is a lockdown.\n\nPersonally I'd be more worried about doing that and seeing F WES-MAO.  But then, life's a gamble.  Plus, with Austria in the Ionian and me in Tyrolia, I'm not sure he'll be going on distant explorations right now.  You might even consider skipping the support.  Run F MAO-Spa/SC and A Mar-Pie.  Not the safest, but it has a certain swagger to it.  And, sadly, I'm not above that being a tiebreaking factor.  \ud83e\udd28", "Thoughts on the Fall?  Spain, I assume.  Nice break that Austria's in the Ionian, which should open up a path for you.\n\nI'm not sure what to do with my A Ruhr, and I'm open to suggestions.  If you do end up supporting from Mar, how do you feel about Tyr-Pie?  I'm not saying I'll do it, but it's an option.  Not a great option, but still.", "Mar to piedmont definitly", "Tyr could support that move or try for Viena, triest, or venice", "I would probably move Ruh to kiel. There arn't really any great options. If england turns on you, you *might* be able to get denmark back, and from kiel you can always convoy.", "Or you could move to munich where you have  access to a lot of stuff.", "ANy thoughts on what I could do with Paris? Rn i'm thinking \nA Bur - Mar\nF MAO - Spa/sc\nA Mar - Pie", "ANd then Paris could go to Burgundy, could hold, could move to gascony, or could move to picardy and then we could work out a convoy and basically send it anywhere", "Which of those do u lke?", "As much as I'd love to see you in Piedmont, you risk missing a build from Spain unless you support yourself in.", "Hmm, ok, so say you move to piedmont. What next? Also what do u think about paris?", "Not sure about Paris.  Piedmont will be open in the Spring - with me in Tyrolia Italy needs his A Ven in the east.", "Russia is reaching out to me about turning on you.  I assume the reverse is also true.  Don't buy it.\n\nThe reality is that he's totally on the ropes right now.  Scandinavia is lost to him, and with France and I starting to pressure Italy and Austria about done, Turkey is already matching his 7 centers and in a much better position both to grow and to stab.\n\nI misread the Turkey relationship - alarm bells were going off, but that was a helluva lot of trust for a game that is (supposedly?) blind.  Given that I'm not confident that it *is* blind, we have to assume that they're acting as one power.\n\nAll of which is just a mush of thoughts; I shared them with England as well to spur discussion.  By the way, what are your plans at this point?  You need to get into the Med in a hurry, of course.  Britain may be able to bring a fleet around to help after the next year or so.  I've got an army I'm able to dedicate, kinda - I'm expecting a push west from Warsaw now.", "Hi germany. Sorry for the late response. I had too much fun on the weekend.", "Can you suppport me into Pie?", "Italy's fleet in Wes is a real pain. I'm going to just need to guess where they are going", "I'll support to Pie.  Move to MAO, with someone moving to Gas and to Mar. You can take back Spain if he slips in, but prevent all sorts of other nonsense if he gets to MAO.  We also need to get you a build if for another fleet.  Else maybe pop an army so you can build.", "F BAL C Kie - Lvn\nF Den - SKA\nA Kie - Lvn\nA Mun - Sil\nA Tyr S Mar - Pie", "You're covering MAO?", "Yes", "A bre - gas\nA bur - Mar\nA mar - Pie\nA par - bur\nF spa/sc - MAO", "We both need builds.  I'll try to support you into Venice.  It *probably* won't work, but there's a shot.  Turkey is heading to the Ionian and it makes sense that he might team up with Russia to take it, which would let my support go through.\n\nI could take it, but it takes me out of position, whereas you'd be able to get Mar through to Pie as well.  On the other hand, I'm assured of taking it, and you can take Belgium - England is vacating.\n\nLet me know what you think.", "F BAL - Swe\n\nA Lvn - Stp\n\nA Mun - Sil\n\nF SKA S BAL - Swe\n\nA Tyr S Pie - Ven\n\n...unless I hear otherwise.", "sounds good", "A Bur - Bel\nA Gas - Spa\nA Mar - Pie\nA Pie - Ven\nF Spa/sc - MAO", "Thanks.  Are you communicating with Britain as well?", "Hey, can I assume those builds will float?  You're racing Turkey, and he has a nice head start...", "Talking a bit with England. Builds will float ofc \ud83d\ude1d", "Well, one of them I guess.\n\nI have to say, you guys are both making me pretty nervous right now.", "Oops. I had sent you a message before explaining that but ig I forgot to press one of the  emojis so it didn't send", "But yeah sorry about that, I had put that in as my orders and then forgot to change them", "Hopefully you don't take that too agressivly... I wont' move them towards you. I'm going to push everything I have at italy", "Hey Germany,\nEverybody vastly overreacted, worrying that I was going to go for the solo, since I had 11 centers. Even though I clearly wasn't going to, literally EVERYONE teamed up against me, reducing me to 9. And frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if the attack continued.  Meanwhile, turkey has gotten 12 centers, and is in a great position\u2014Russia is exposed, and they are likely going to break through my defenses as well. It's more than likely that turkey is going for the solo. Just saying\u2014if turkey wins, it's because all of u guys were selfish and ignored the bigger threat at hand. On that note, I hope turkey doesn't win, and that we can come together to stop them(much like you did to me). BTW I am sending this message to everybody. Hopefully we can work together to stop turkey", "So, can we agree that we all need to put everything aside and stop Turkey?  He's 3 away from the solo...\n\nI know I can't do much, but I can support y'all as needed and do whatever else I can.\n\n(Sending to all remaining powers that aren't Turkey)", "Ha, I already did that but not too you because of how puny you are \ud83d\ude35", "...and Russia, then?", "Because it seems you're running out of potential allies.", "Hey, I think we can agree that we need to take whatever measures possilble to stop Turkey from getting one more supply center. We just need to last one more year, and I think with some communication it might be possible. Please support me from Burgundy into munich.", "Im also attacking venice and rome", "I told england to support you in your territores, as Englands centers will not be taken but yours very possible might be.", "This game is probably over, but we need to try", "I legitimantly think we can stop turkey from getting one more center. Support me hold in munich, and I will attack Tyr, which means that I keep munich no matter what.  I'm making a play on rome, and may get that. Turkey doesn't have enough force to take any centers(berlin or Stp)", "What about:", "I was thinking A Ber - Sil\nF Kie - BAL\n\nwith\n\nF BAL - BOT\nF Nwy - Stp/nc\nF Pru S Stp - Lvn\nA Stp - Lvn\n\nand\n\nA Hol - Ruh\nA Mun - Boh\nA Pie - Tyr\nF Tun S TYS - ION\nA Tus - Rom\nF TYS - ION\n\nI think Munich is safe no matter what happens (except if he vacates Bohemia).\nSt Petersburg is most likely locked down.\nHe expects you to move to Venice.  My guess is that he'll support himself on.  Let him.  You'll either slide into Rome or stop his fleet from doing the same.\nYour fleet in TYS is protected.\nI get to build an army, which should be the nail in the coffin of his chances to take a centre north of Switzerland.\n\nThoughts?", "Ok, these moves are good. But most of this doesn't even matter, because this is the last season before the hard cap. Right now my orders are the same as the ones you said, but Munich is holding. It makes more sense, because if I got into Boh, I would lose Munich.", "But...what if he has Boh support a move to Munich from one of the other two?  You're equally sunk.\n\nYou're right, of course.  That is the one scenario that's a problem.  It's just that I think it's the least likely - far less likely than Boh providing the support for an attack.  That's because we don't have a unit adjacent to Bohemia, so we can't break the support.\n\nUnless you're going to double support Munich, we have to do it this way.  Elsewise, if he double supports (with one support from Boh) we're toast, and we have no way to know which of the supports we should hit.", "Yeah, which is why I think berlin should support munich.", "Play it out.\n\nBerlin supports Munich Hold.\nPiedmont to Tyrolia.\n\nTurkey:\nTyr-Mun\nBoh s Tyr-Mun\nSil s Tyr-Mun [or] s War-Pru [or] something else.\n\nMunich is lost, and there are armies in 2 of Trieste, Venice, and Rome.  Probably those last two (convoy from Alb).", "I think the chance that Tyr moves to Mun is less of a risk Mun moving to Boh", "Possibly.  Everyone's different.\n\nIf you were him, your move would be to move the one unit that can support without risk of being broken?  Bohemia is definitely, definitely going to support.  If he puts everything into taking Munich we can't stop him.  But as long as Russia doesn't move to Burgandy we can make him pay, and have it back for the last fall turn.\n\nIf he takes it from Tyr or Sil, you retreat to Burgandy and between us we have armies in Ruh, Bur, and two of Ber, Tyr, or Sil, right?\nIf he tries to take it from Boh, he fails, and we have all of those except Mun instead of Bur.  If he moves Boh somewhere else, Munich falls to any move from Sil or Tyr, but we're in an even better position - we're in Boh now, with position both on Munich and Vienna.", "Ok, you convinced me", "Which almost certainly means that I'll be catastrophically wrong, of course.", "You'll be wanting to retreat to burgundy now.", "Tsk tsk, I told you I was right", "What are you thinking for moves?", "The result of being wrong was better my way, and you would have lost it either way.\n\nHaven't looked yet.

{"messages": ["Hello Turkey, nice to make your acquaintance. \n\nI've been thinking about this game alot, because the fact that it will only last until 1910 really changes my strategy. Add in that no one is likely to NMR and I believe it will be near impossible to solo. As such, it really only makes sense to find a ride or die partner for close tactical coordination and grab as many centers as possible.\n\nAs I'm sure you know, when R/T can trust each other and are firing on all 8 the Juggernaut can be nearly unstoppable. You, as Turkey, are my number 1 preferred partner in this game. I propose that we ally to dominate the Eastern sphere of this game. Do you agree?", "I mean, who doesn't like a good Juggernaut?  Always a fun start to the game!  \n\nHow do you like to play it?  Standard bounce in Black then go our own way West, or something a little fancier that requires a bit more trust?

Have to take some time to think about this tactically but I think we're in a good spot.\n\n I'm kind of surprised Italy took Trieste, that's statistically a pretty bad move for Italy.", "But a good move for us, unless it's a Key - which it likely isn't, because the moving the second fleet north hurts that opening.\n\nSo...umm...  Carry on, I guess.  You're pretty well guaranteed two builds.", "Alrighty then - looks like there will be no coherent defense from the West.", "Italy getting two builds concerns me a little bit. I want to make sure that you gain two builds if possible in 1902. I'm worried that Italy is going to throw two fleets at you and to be honest losing you would be crippling for my game.\n\nI've been toying with the idea of asking for an Alliance of you, Germany and I to go to 1910 together. I think it's the only thing that makes strategic sense. I can help you with Italy and Germany with England, and all three of us can end up with 10+ centers at the end of 1910.  Do you have any input on this idea?", "I'm ok with that - and his current issues aside, France is a reasonable alternative to Germany there - especially as I half-expect England/Germany to pull back and react to your three builds.  But I'm good either way.\n\nIn any event, yes, I expect Italy to drop two fleets and position on me.  If Austria were actually communicative I'd be trying to spin my positioning as protecting him, but at the moment I'm talking to a wall.  Which is somewhat moot if we move fast enough - he shouldn't really have enough time to firm up a credible defense.", "So...interestingly, I was having a conversation with the admin about why I would give an order for my army to be convoyed by your Black Sea fleet even though that wasn't ever something I asked for or discussed.  And it makes me wonder - did you see that move as me sending a message, and if so what message?", "Well, I can tell you that it totally faked out Germany.  They think that I screwed you by not convoying and the Jug isn't even on their radar at the moment. In that aspect it was amazingly successful. Tactically it's not a bad move, keeping an army back offers you a little insurance against an Armenian stab this year (of course I wasn't stabbing anyway, but insurance never hurts). If you had gained two builds it would have left Con and Smy open to build fleets in. Good move.", "Germany called it \"an obvious bit of Lucy pulling the football away from Charlie Brown\"", "What are you thinking in regards to the Balkans this turn? I've got a possible idea, but I need to kick the tactics around in my head for a minute before I explain it.", "I think this set of moves is the safe, normal play here:\n\nRussia\nA BUD-VIE\nA RUM S BUL-SER\nF BLA C ANK-BUL\nA SEV-UKR\n\nTurkey\nA BUL-SER\nA ANK-BUL\n\nI think there are other options as well, like if I supported Austria from Serbia to Trieste, allowing you to move into Serbia, keeping Austria at 3 centers and harming Italy. That kind of move has a much greater risk of blowing up in our faces, however.\n\n I'm willing to follow your lead  here, you tell me which way to jump.", "Well hello, lots of messages to catch up on.  So the convoy move had more or less the intended effect. \ud83d\ude00\n\nI *finally* am getting responses from Austria, so trying to stand Italy out of Ionian in the sitting is an option. Otherwise it's fall back on original plan which is basically the moves you have up above.

You and Germany are the only ones seemingly willing to communicate with me, and Germany has been talked into a bad faith deal with England it appears. I'm trying to use England's NMR to drive a wedge in that relationship now.", "I think the way we played 1901 made Germany think that I am a giant threat, when in actuality I really do want to work with Germany. \n\nDo you think we can get you in Trieste this year?", "Quite possibly. You'll want me to tap it anyway to help protect Vienna.", "Found the negotiation point with Germany - he wants Trieste.

Germany obviously doesn't like you.", "What makes you think that Germany doesn't \"like\" me?", "He said it.", "He said that he didn't like me?  What are we, middle school kids?", "Apparently.  I haven't talked to anyone enough. Maybe he's just trying to stop a wintergreen.", "Well ... what are your thoughts on a Wintergreen?  That's a Russia-Italy partnership, right?", "It is Russo-Italian.", "Austria is going to hedgehog though so I doubt we can get together soon.", "hedgehog?  You mean he's going to open with his fleet to Venice?", "Yes he's adamant on a ven move.", "Interesting. That did not appear to be a hedgehog.", "No I'm not sure what he's doing.", "I wish you were in Tyrol.", "Well I thought the move would fail.", "Who did you think would open there?", "Nobody but without ven it'd be bad.", "Do you want to attack Austria together? You could try for Trieste again or go for position.", "so... are doing a crafty lepanto or would you like to team up on Austria together? I\u2019d be down for a split of Austria, then we take out turkey. Thoughts?", "He can't stop us both!", "You really like Tyrolia!", "I heard there was a supply center rush in Germany and wanted my fair share.", "Interesting. Usually Italy doesn\u2019t bypass Austria to go after German dots. That\u2019s an unsustainable position.  We also have two on Vienna, if you\u2019re interested.", "Looks like you're full on moving towards Germany", "you online?", "So, I'd be curious as to your thoughts going into this year.  Any interest in working together to divide up Austria quickly, and then take out Turkey?", "Looks like you were working with Austria there. Changing it up?", "He disbanded an army.

I didnt know if it was necessary for me to say anything.", "Literally everybody else was saying something.", "And good for you. I haven't missed any turns in my 3 conspiracy games.", "And, I even asked you to chime in. But, like every other request of you I\u2019ve made - you ignored it.", "And I was waiting for the moderator to say what he needed.", "That\u2019s great. Why could t you get your orders in for the game that you\u2019re getting paid to participate in?", "He did. He said he\u2019s restart them game if all players agreed. Dude, it\u2019s cool. You thought you had an advantageous position so why restart?", "But own it. Don\u2019t pretend, after you bolo some moves, that you wanted the restart all along.

After missing orders I think he's through.", "too bad France is on your ass, otherwise you could possibly slip into Trieste.", "Yeah and France wont talk. Its okay. It all my fault.", "Like a candle, burning from both ends.  You lit up the table, my friend - but you're running out of wick.", "I'd be fine if I hit the submit button", "Won't you be down to four centers?", "Yeah I'm gonna die.

Would you mind letting me into Sweden?", "If I let you into Sweden, you wont build north and you wont attack me?", "My offer of fleet Sweden as your proxy still stands. And no, I won\u2019t attack you. I might build A STP, but definitely not F STP/sc", "Okay, I'll allow you in, but if you build army st pete then I dont want that unit moving without me knowing where it is going each phase.", "Ok. Sounds a little paranoid, but fair. Neither France or England are being forthcoming...", "England tricked me. Now I must kill them. I'm building a fleet to use against England. I will support you in the spring if you promise to use that to contest Norway. I apologize for bouncing you, I did it to secure a relationship with England, but he threw that away.", "Fleet Kiel, correct?", "I looked at the map and see that you only have Berlin open. Thank you for the heads up.", "Yes, I can only do Berlin", "So, what\u2019s the plan? Do you think you\u2019ve got a friend in France?", "To give you my perspective, when I play Germany, I don\u2019t bounce Sweden in \u201801 as a general rule. I wait and see if England is working with me - if he is, taking out the solo fleet is too easy and slows down English gains. If he isn\u2019t, then now I have a potential ally in place to help.  And if England and Russia are going to team up on me, I\u2019m screwed anyway - but at least I haven\u2019t provided Russia with additional motivation.   Now, WAR-SIL changes that math.", "Well I see the merit in most of this, I think you are discounting a build in St Pete by Russia. Russia can easily get a second unit North, and then it isn't just a lone fleet in Sweden. I still dont trust France completely, but at this point I have no other choice than to work with you and France. England openly attacked me, and neither you nor France have.", "Okay, am I supporting you into Sweden? If you are covering St Pete I'd like to go Sweden to ensure England doesnt get it. Just let me know what to do.", "I\u2019m going to Sweden", "Awesome, I'm supporting you", "Thank you.", "Thank you for your assistance.  It would appear that England is coming for you, full bore.  Is France on your side?", "Oh thank goodness. It appears France is on my side. Idk why England has it out for me, but it's annoying. I may need you to either go to Norway or support hold Denmark if you can?", "Norway is intriguing.  I wish I was in STP right now.  \ud83d\ude26", "Well at least you have the juggernaut going for you now \ud83d\ude09", "This guy ... \"let's try to hide it by me pretending to attack you.\"  \ud83d\udc4c \ud83d\ude29", "no one believes it's not a juggernaut until Russia is in Bulgaria or Turkey is in Rumania.", "Austria has asked me to move my units towards you (away from him, I suppose).  How did your discussions with Italy go regarding his unit in Tyrolia?  He seems to have fled south quickly (most likely to convoy over to Syria).", "Actually I didn't even talk to him last phase, and the phase before I just said that attacking Austria was dumb unless he was in a wintergreen alliance.", "well, that was apparently the way to get him to go south.", "Even with my help, you could still lose Denmark.", "He has three fleets to attack with. If Denmark holds and Kiel and Sweden support hold, he cant take it.", "Oh. Yeah. Math.", "For what it\u2019s worth, France hasn\u2019t asked me to move west or anything. So, he\u2019s probably your friend.", "That's good to know, thanks", "England just sent me a message that says he is going to take Denmark and then stop attacking me because of France... \nLike... what is he doing?", "I had an opportunity to DMZ the north, sorry. Though, now that England left North Sea as a retreat location, I might not find Norway such easy pickings ...", "hi.  did you want to talk at all?", "I mean", "Is there any way of me getting your help this phase?", "I'm not actually in any of your centers.", "But you supported England into my SC after I supported you", "what do you want?  would you prefer to focus on england?", "I thought I made myself clear that England was my whole focus last phase. Now that you've allied with England against me, I have two people to be mad at now. You attacking me is more understandable than England though", "Oh... except you are in Bohemia and Silesia", "well, he agreed to dmz the north, as i explained, and then he made the moves to support it.", "I am.", "Look, it doesn't do me great good to knock you out of the game right away.  I was wondering if you'd be open to a dialogue or are you closed off to any kind of dicussions.", "I mean I'm open to discussion, but I'm using most of my efforts with other countries since I feel like I wont be able to get very far this phase with you. In later phases things will change though", "My only real bargaining chip is helping you against England in Scandinavia, or supporting you against Austria", "How would you suggest going about helping me against Austria?", "Well... tbh I am mostly going to be holding this phase. I'm going to Munich though, and if you relieve pressure on me I can continue south and support you there.", "I wouldn't mind you disbanding one of your 5 northern troops. Tbh, I dont know why you only have 2 troops protecting your south when Austria and Turkey can both attack you strongly now.", "Thought England was interested in working with me against you.  I have no idea why he went for Sweden instead of taking a (guaranteed) support into Kiel.  Sorry.", "You're apologizing to me for England not attacking me?", "Sure", "I\u2019m apologizing for trusting him.", "Would you like support into Denmark?", "If I order Kiel to Denmark you could take Berlin by force. Once you've backed off my border I'll consider moving my troops in a way other than protecting myself against invaders.", "That\u2019s totally fair. I\u2019ll make that a possibility.", "what do you want me to build?", "An army would be preferable", "done.  can we go our separate ways?", "Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what Austria and Italy are doing now", "well, Italy is about to get desparate for dots.  So, I'd watch your back.", "I build the army and would like to head south.  I'd appreciate it if you held off from attacking STP or headed towards Warsaw.  i honestly believe that you have bigger fish to fry and can makes some great headway with your fleets if you head west.", "Why are you sending your fleet at me?", "Please, if I wanted to attack you I'd go from Norway. Baltic was going to cover Berlin, but now it will bounce in Denmark", "classical mid-game mistake, going after Russia instead of Austria.", "the problem with weakening Russia at this point - is by the time you shift towards Austria, there's no  way to beat him off - and you can't hold Warsaw and Moscow against him.", "He only has 4 SCs", "Well, who do you think will get Italy\u2019s", "France?",

{"messages": ["Hello germany! I figured we should open up talks", "Yes, most certainly. I would very much like to work with you against Russia to keep him from dominating the North, and working against France together would also be great. E/G is one of my favorite alliances to play.", "Would you be okay with the idea of me having Hol? The fifth build can be tough for England.", "I would very much not be okay with you having Hol, it's an SC directly bordering my home. I can help you into Bel though, or help you against Russia into Sweden or St Pete for that extra SC or 2.", "Understandable but worth the ask in my opinion. Not trying to be overly aggressive.", "I don\u2019t want to overcommit to attacking anyone this early, but I appreciate you offering support. So you don\u2019t think you and France will be friendly?", "As a western power I usually stay undecided as to who I really want to work with during the first year. But generally speaking I prefer an E/G over an F/G or E/F. It just makes dealing with Russia so much easier.", "Makes sense I play germany the same way, any time that I am too aggressive or get 6 in the first year I end up getting ganged up on.", "So Russia sent me a message asking for a deal. He said if I would help him into Sweden he would support me into North Sea after he takes Norway. This obviously raises some red flags since he is already assuming he will take Norway. I'd be surprised if he wasn't opening Moscow to St Pete.", "He told me he wants to open against Germany, and that he would help me into Denmark from Sweden \ud83d\ude02 I didn\u2019t believe him (and voted so) because that is a terrible opening for Russia. Seems like he is a troublemaker", "Lol. Yeah, he's the only person I've thumbs downed so far.", "So he told austria to his face that he plans on moving into Gal (according to Austria) seems like a wildcard", "Have you actually talked to France yet", "I sent a message. He just responded. Reading it next.", "How\u2019d that go?", "Well, he told me he was supporting himself into Burgundy, so uhhhh.... not really liking him so far", "Oof, yeah that is aggressive. At least he\u2019s honest?", "He could be bluffing. Get me to think that moving to Bur is pointless and that I should stay in Munich. Instead he blitzes north to Pic and takes Bur from Marseilles uncontested. Now he has two units poised to take Bel or possibly attack Munich if I do leave. Either way, telling me that is not good news for me", "Yeah it means he will not be friendly. I\u2019ll be in NTH so I\u2019ll be in a powerful position. I\u2019ll be happy to lend support assuming I am cleared to get Nwy. Just let me know", "Yeah I think we'll be fine, it's just hard that France and Russia are both playing against us.", "We will see what russia actually does, they seem like a wildcard", "Well, you are poised to take Norway, and I can bounce Russia out of Sweden. I'd like to take Holland, but you can have Belgium. Unfortunately France did get into Burgundy like he said, so he could either go to Munich or Belgium.", "Yeah I am trying to find out for you (discretely) if he will be hitting Munich. Are you actually planning on bouncing Swe? I think it\u2019s a fun move. How do you want to handle the French threat? I might be able to bounce him  in Bel or even take it if he goes Mun like I would expect", "In full disclosure, France offered to go to EC and I said I'd love that, fully expecting him to never go there (why would he give up a build to go EC?). France told me that you were lobbying for him to go to Ruhr, which doesn't exactly match up with the last message you just sent me.", "If France doesn't go to Bel, Spain, and Portugal I would be very surprised. I'm going to cover Munich regardless, it's too big of a risk to let him in.", "That makes sense, that\u2019s annoying that France is trying to split us up. At least I can bounce him in Bel. Are you doing the russia bounce? If I am going to stand with you I need to know if I have to prepare for some Russian anger", "Yeah I lied to Russia.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 sounds good, so how do you want me to play this turn? Hit bel?", "You never denied that you told France to go to Ruhr.", "I'm too paranoid for this game", "I would love it if you went to Bel", "I did not tell France to go Ruh, I don\u2019t want that much pressure on you and it would be better for us if he went Bel and I bounced him", "Well that was kinda dumb on your part. You knew I was going to Holland, so you didn't get a build AND you made me mad. I was soooooo sold on allying with you all game, but not anymore. Can you please explain your thought process there?", "Not sure what I need to explain, I feel like I have more to gain siding with France, especially since you have angered Russia.", "Except that France is now at 6 SCs and you are at 4 and I'm much more angry at you. France is in a much better position than you now.", "I still dont understand why you are gunning for me. I literally was ready to work with you wholeheartedly and you are attacking me while leaving yourself open to Russia and France who are not exactly helping you back. I guess their lies are more persuasive than my truth...", "I stabbed you but now it looks like France is stabbing me. I\u2019m going to stop attacking you after I take Den", "Lol. Or you could not take Denmark, protect yourself, and try to stop France.", "So if you stop attacking me I will shift all aggression to Russia.", "If you want to help stop Russia from rolling me (then possibly teaming up with France against you) I would appreciate Denmark tapping Baltic.", "I\u2019d consider it if you could get France off my back", "I tried working with you against France at the beginning and you declined. Now it's a bit late, as I warned you before. I can try to get him to back off, but it will be very difficult at this point.", "Yeah I\u2019m not saying that we have a full alliance but there\u2019s no reason for me to just help you, especially when it would leave me with 0 allies", "Do you have more than 0 allies right now? I wouldn't consider Russia an ally so much as he isn't going to attack you until I'm dead. Russia has turned on Turkey when convenient, turned on Austria when convenient, and Italy thought they were allies when they weren't. Trusting Russia will kill you.", "Okay so several countries have come to me saying that you are painting me as not wanting to work with you. That's entirely false. I have made 0 moves against you. You have attacked me. I have asked for your help against Russia, you said you would only do it if I somehow got France to help.\nFrom my point of view I have done everything in my power to work with you, and you are spurning me at any chance you get.\nPlease stop working against me. Please stop spreading false ideas about me. Is there something I did to personally offend you?", "I am not trying to spread lies, I genuinely feel as though you have no interest in working with me. I was under the impression that you said that it was \u201ctoo late\u201d for us to work together. England/Germany/France is always a 2 on 1, usually with England choosing their side. I played both and decided to go with France mainly because their plan and communication felt better. I chose wrong, and I am paying dearly for it. I apologize for doing so. At this point it feels as though you are working with France, which is inherently against me. If I have read that wrong then I apologize, but for those reasons I could not just go against Russia because in doing so I would cause a 3 on 1. That is why I asked you to get France off of me in exchange, it is the only way I survive. Otherwise it doesn\u2019t make a difference to me if I lose and France wins or I lose and Russia wins.", "I am honestly sorry for how our game has started, and I am proposing an alliance between the two of us. I know that it will be hard for you to trust me, but I think that you can see that it is my only option, and so to betray you again would be short sighted and suicidal. If you can\u2019t trust me, then I have no choice but to hope russia wants me as his sidekick given my navel power. I don\u2019t want that to be my role in this game, so I hope that you will consider my proposal.", "Thank you for being honest with me now. I'm not working against you at all. I am very interested in working with you, considering that I was the one who approached you and asked to work against Russia together. \nI actually felt like you didn't want to work with me, because you were saying you wouldn't work with me unless France backed off - something I cant control.", "I have been talking with France, and I think i might have actually got him properly scared of Russia to back off of you. I'm waiting to hear back from my latest message, but he will only do it if you actually do help against Russia, something I still dont know if i can trust you on.", "So how do we do this. I can help you by stopping russia in the north, you can help me by putting some pressure on France so that he has to go home. What do you think about me supporting you into the Bal from Kiel and supporting you into Bel. You push back russia a little, and cost France a build if you cut the Bur support.", "Oh so you don\u2019t want to go against France?", "I cant attack France with Munich this turn. I will likely lose Munich if I attack Bur, and then that does me no good at all, since I'll be at like 1 SC at the end of the year.", "That\u2019s fair, how about that Kiel move then", "If Russia moves Baltic into Berlin with support than I have lost Berlin, vacated Kiel, and again I'm down to like 2 SCs. I really do want to work with you, but you and Russia put me in a super super bad position and I pretty much have to hold this phase. I have tried to think of ways around it and I just cant.", "Holland is free though", "I suppose if I trusted you and France 100% I could use Holland to cover for Kiel", "I am sending NTH to Lon this year (I hope it works) which would make you feel better. If you want this to work you will have to trust me.", "Honestly I think the best help might just be tapping Baltic for me so that I can hold everything tight this phase, but that's just going to stall everything out, so idk. This game is pretty hopeless for me I'm afraid.", "Me as well, I messed up things for both of us and I apologize. Why don\u2019t I just gamble and take Sweden?", "Well, BOT is probably going to Sweden, so that also wouldn't be a terrible move", "BOT might fill Bal, he thinks I\u2019m getting him into Ber this turn", "Where are you supposed to be supporting him from?", "Oh... Bal", "Yep, obviously I will not though", "Okay, yeah, this is good.

He contacted you but I would probably be able to", "Like I told England I would talk to you.

{"messages": ["Greetings and salutations!  I prefer not to bounce in Galicia - it weakens Austria against Italy since you can't cover Trieste and it means I HAVE to move Moscow to Ukraine, which commits that unit to a southern direction early.  What are you thoughts?", "I\u2019m not a fan of fighting Italy or Russia as Austria. Germany will also probably guarantee Tyr. I just want to survive, and you two are capable of picking me apart. Is there some sort of arrangement we can come to with turkey and the Balkans that doesn\u2019t involve me wasting away in the carpathians?", "How much of Turkey are you willing to let the Italian have?  I'd like two centers and I'd be comfortable with you having Bulgaria - as long as you were willing to head after Italy next.", "Two centers is a lot to give if I\u2019m doing the heavy lifting and then fighting Italy on top of it unless you\u2019re going through Arm? I assumed you\u2019d be going north?", "I mean, I'm assuming you've got Italy doing a Lepanto and getting out of position.   When you said an arrangement with Turkey  - did you mean the three of us working together or you and I splitting him up.  'Cause if we split him up, then a 50/50 split seems pretty fair, right?  I'd get two, and you'd get Bulgaria and another.", "I meant carving him up. If you take the Armenian opening, I\u2019m fine with a 2 & 1 + 1.", "I just need some time to figure out Gal. I can always use Gal to support you into Rum?", "The Armenian opening?  What is that?  I've never heard of it.", "There\u2019s a couple ways to do it. The most sure fire is F Sev - Rum; A Mos - Sev; A War - Ukr;\nF Rum - Sev; A Ukr - Sev; A Sev - Arm", "The less sure is hoping you don\u2019t bounce in Black while moving A Mos - Sev \u2014> A Sev - Arm; F Black - Bul EC; A Ukr - Rum.", "I think I would prefer to sit back and see what's happening before committing so strongly to an opening like that.", "I would prefer if we left Galicia a DMZ, I'm not comfortable with you moving in there in '01.  I think keeping it unoccupied during the game would be best for us to have a partnership.", "May I ask what your intentions are with War and Mos? They have to go somewhere, and they both don\u2019t fit down south if you don\u2019t move into Gal or Sev.", "I prefer to hold with Moscow and see who's telling me the truth.", "Have you been telling people that you\u2019re opening to Galicia? I\u2019ve had several players ask me if I\u2019m bouncing you there.", "No, I have not told anyone that I\u2019m moving to Galicia. I\u2019ve even told a couple that I wasn\u2019t going to. The only reason that would happen is if you and I don\u2019t work out an agreement and I have to do a hedgehog.", "I would like to stress that my preference is for Gal to be a DMZ with no bounces", "I need confirmation from you that you\u2019re staying out of Gal. I don\u2019t want to destabilize things by moving there if you\u2019re not attacking it.", "Getting to my phone now.  My preference is to DMZ Galicia as well.", "Cool. I\u2019m moving a standard Austrian opening that gives me flexibility with Greece and Italy.", "I changed my orders to Galicia because (a) I felt that you waffled back and forth on it and (b) corroboration from other players.", "And I\u2019d rather guess wrong and be there myself than guess wrong and have someone else be there.", "Who told you I was moving there? I never told anyone that I was moving Gal. I only ever said that I might hedgehog if you kept me in the dark. I\u2019m asking who gave you the Gal info because I want to make sure I don\u2019t get stabbed again.", "If you want to try and repair the relationship, will you move A Gal - Rum?", "I\u2019m open to that. When I was told you were looking to hedgehog, the word \u201cmight\u201d was dropped off. Then I had to google \u201cAustria\u201d and \u201chedgehog\u201d and .... that\u2019s a low win probability opening IMO.", "Yeah, it is, because it means that Austria has no friends and is doomed to die first. I hate it and almost prefer to do a key Lepanto over a hedgehog.", "I\u2019ve never willingly participated in a Key lepanto.", "I\u2019ve done it twice and it worked, but those were on an android app where people were more likely to do silly things.", "I have had one or two forced on me, and in my past 5 or so games I had to fight one off as Turkey.", "France benefited from that one.", "What\u2019s going on in Tyolia? Was Italy supposed to go to Venice as well?", "Nothing good is going on. That was an unnecessary move", "Well, unnecessary if you\u2019re going to parent with him, yes. I left Galicia and that should give us some space to work together, if you\u2019d like to make a suggestion.", "I\u2019m thinking. I\u2019ll have to get back to you. Italy and France getting 3 builds presents a bit of a pickle.", "I think an EF is good for you.", "Hey, I\u2019ll be back online around 7 pm est. if you\u2019d like to talk about how we proceed with respect to The balkans.", "Would you mind sharing why you picked A War over A Mos?", "Yes. England asked me to build there.", "He\u2019s asked me to go after Germany with him.", "Turkey, of course, is asking me to send it to Galicia. Which is why I\u2019d really like to talk to you about the balkans", "France is going to eat up most of those gains if you pressure Germany from the west, and then take England easily. France has the largest navy and no real threats. That being said, your relations with the West are none of my business.", "What do you think about F Sev - Arm,  A Ukr - Sev, A Rum S A Ukr - Sev, A Serb S A Rum hold", "Depending on how the spring shapes up, I will be able to act more directly against the Turks.", "That seems like a horrible set of orders.  Why not suggest that I cut BLA with SEV and either you support me into Bulgaria or I support you into Bulgaria?  It sounds like you're trying to get me out of position and slow Turkey down while you work with him.", "I\u2019m not meaning to push you out of position. Turkey built F Smy and is probably going to hit Greece and move his armies up behind him. If he does that, he\u2019ll have to either rush losing Ank or cede control of Black. I\u2019m hoping to have a more certain lay of the land after spring and expect to be in a place where I can help take down Turkey. If I attack Turkey now, I\u2019ll lose what little advantage I have over turkey. I\u2019m not putting my foot down and saying I\u2019m committed to the orders I suggested. If you are totally opposed to my order suggestion, we can keep talking.", "If the Italians scare me, I don\u2019t want to worry about you or Turkey. If the Italians keep their word, I\u2019ll be fighting Turkey, not you. That\u2019s why I want you to shift East", "Ok.  Explain to me why you're in the Ionian and not in Greece?", "I'm just very confused why you would  go there instead of Greece  - I understand the need to self-bounce in Budapest, but the move to Ionian confuses me.", "There are two reasons for Austria to have a fleet in the Ionian in Spring 1902. The first is for Austria to attack Italy. The second is to make it seem like Austria is attacking Italy when really the target is in either France or Turkey. I didn\u2019t go for Greece because Turkey said he wasn\u2019t going to go for it last year and leaving it open bought me some good will. Also, I wasn\u2019t sure if you and Italy  were going to screw me, so I tried to avoid upsetting any of you. Regardless of if you believe me, Turkey\u2019s Armenian flank is exposed and I\u2019m not in a position to attack you because I built in Trie and  Hungary / Bud is unoccupied.", "Also, I didn\u2019t move into Gal at the start of the game, like I promised and took you at your word when you said you moved into Gal because of bad intel.", "alright.  well, I think you've put yourself way out of position.  Turkey has asked me to support his attack on Serbia, and I'm going to, so if Italy taps you in Trieste and Turkey is telling me the truth, you'll lose it.  Let's be honest with ourselves, if both Italy AND Turkey want to attack Austria, Russia is pretty much always going to join in.  Maybe Turkey is lying to me and is going to work with you to force Rumania or something.  I doubt it though.  I wish you the best of luck and i'm sorry if things turn out super bad for you.  In the future, if you ever get the idea to do anything with your fleet other than use it to take greece - you need to crush that good idea fairy quickly.  Turning it into an extra army through a build is super, super important.", "I wish you had defended against the attack I described to you.  Unfortunately, you didn't.  Any suggestions ?  You're about to go down a unit.", "You can switch sides and hit Bul instead of me? Italy has access to Smyrna and the Turkish right flank is still open. A Rum - Bul, F Sev - Arm, A Gal - Ukr, a War - Ukr? You can pick up Bul and Ank before anyone else is able to mess around.", "You\u2019ll also be able to build another southern fleet if you wanted to", "I mean, this would work a lot better if you had held Serbia.", "Why didn't you support yourself to hold?", "Because you telling me you\u2019re going to hit a certain territory only lets me know I need to defend something, and not what territory in particular, so I turtled.", "I suppose I could have been trying to slip into GAL and  BUD while getting you to just order mutual support orders ... but I prefer to order supports to moves I know will go through.  I guess I projected that onto you instead of putting myself in your - understandably - paranoid shoes.", "I\u2019ve trusted you before but trusting you and Italy at the same time was more than I could do. I tried to signal the blue water Lepanto without outright telling you. Do you have any suggestions?", "Next time, don't do a blue water lepanto.  I played face-to-face on Sunday as Russia and Austria and Italy tried to do a blue water lepanto.  I probably could have soloed, but I didn't build a fleet sev.", "Now, a suggestion more specific to this game?  Let me look at the board.", "It was that or die in year one. Italy opened asking for a key. I\u2019ve never worked well in an Austro-Turkish alliance and the rest almost pushed me to a hedgehog. I did what I could.", "Ok, that's a tough situation.", "And then the asshole in Russia opens to Galicia.  It's enough to drive a man to drink.", "I had a bit of tequila tonight...", "Ok, here's a thought - what if you support me into Serbia, I move my fleet SEV-RUM, and then build a second southern fleet.  In the next year, I crush into Bulgaria, you backfill Serbia and take Greece - rebuilding all the way.", "I know it's not ideal for you, but ... you did the blue water lepanto, why not try this?", "Yeah, I\u2019ll take a fleet in Rum all day.", "Where do Gal and War go?", "West?", "Or I could support myself to hold.", "you probably can't afford me lying to you on this one and then doing something with the units that leaves another center exposed..", "I\u2019m losing a center, I\u2019d prefer Gal cleared. If you have to eat Germany then fine. England is off balance if they plan on working with France instead of bottling up in Nth, and that alliance has to fall apart.", "I have GAL-BOH ordered.", "Is war going Sil or back filling Ukr or something? I know you could just lie, but I still feel like it\u2019d be negligent for me to not ask.", "Actually, I could lie to you.  But I have given it some thought.  I think you genuinely want to work with me.  and I actually want to work with you (not a big fan of Turkey making so many gains!).  I will move WAR-SIL as well.", "I\u2019m pretty sure Turkey is covering Smyrna (and I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re convoying Apulia to Syria", "You going to keep your southern fleet or give up on the med?", "I\u2019m weighing the f sev build because I don\u2019t know if we need two fleets back there. Thoughts?", "You coordinated the shift to Serb & Greece with turkey and didn\u2019t need my support. If you don\u2019t build it, I\u2019ll assume your 1902 dealing was in bad faith.", "Ok. I see your point. But I cleared Galicia.", "I\u2019m asking if you really think that we need two Russian fleets.", "And, well ... you know what? Yes. Yes we do. Because that\u2019s what it will take for us to have peace.   (I ask the right to revisit this pending Germany\u2019s retreat order).", "You can\u2019t clear the Black Sea without a second fleet. You have two armies on Germany\u2019s border, but if we have to revisit it after the retreat, then that\u2019s what we have to do.", "You know, with Italy SO far out of position, you could just run in on him.   And yeah, I'll build the second fleet.  if anything, it will give you and I three fleets in the Med, which will be useful for after you take on Italy.  Which is going to happen at some point, right?  Otherwise, I'm not really sure where you'd go.", "Obviously, we need to resolve what's going on in the Balkans, etc.  But, I find it useful and beneficial to discuss the long term picture with allies.  And, after my moves and the build I'm about to make, I'd like you to consider me an ally - or at least a potential one.  What are your impressions of Italy - is he a straight shooter with middle management written all over him?  Do you think you can trust him or work with him after Turkey is cracked?", "I had to build up North, unfortunately. I still think I can slip into the Black Sea. He\u2019s going to be focused on the south, I\u2019m pretty sure.", "Was the bounce in Vienna prearranged?", "It doesn\u2019t look like it was, with the fleet move to Adriatic.", "The bounce was prearranged", "For what it\u2019s worth, Italy told me that he was going to attack you this past turn.", "But, with respect to our border, let\u2019s take BUL  and Greece off of Turkey this turn.", "Not sure what we\u2019re doing together.", "I will (waste) a turn and order defensive moves.", "Do you have any interest in improving your position and/or playing Diplomacy?  I'd like to work with you, but you're making it extremely difficult by ignoring my messages and not making any suggestions.", "I would like to head south.  If you could head in a direction that isn't warsaw, I think that we could work together.  Are you still tied to working with Italy or are you open to another path?", "So... care to work together? I could use some help to keep Germany out of Warsaw.", "I can\u2019t support you against the Germans directly, but I can help against Turkey and stay out of Sev, freeing up another unit?", "I don't understand why you can't help against Germany.  If it's a \"I want to work with him\" thing, he will head after you once he's done with me.  If it's a \"I've got something else for UKR to do ... \"  then you're lying to me.", "That\u2019s really frustrating what Italy just did to you. It\u2019s too bad that you\u2019 continued to work with him instead of helping me defend against Germany.", "Now, I can\u2019t hold anything north of STP. That is, until France attacks him.", "I mean north of Sev.", "Are you able to work with me against Turkey?", "Because I\u2019d like to assume you\u2019re done working with Italy.", "Would you like to try to work together here?  I haven't attacked you the entire game.  I've been asking you for help.  You've also only replied to one message from me in the past month.", "I'd be willing to offer you support into Warsaw.", "Ok. If we don\u2019t all work together, France our Germany will win.", "How are you going to bury the hatchet with turkey?", "I don't see why that's necessary.", "Also, because you let Germany take Warsaw, they're already past the stalemate line.  There's really nothing we can do to stop them.", "What we need is for one of them to turn on the other and try to get a solo.  But, me and Turkey patching things up is really inconsequential to the whole thing.  Especially since he disbanded a fleet.", "My game was ruined the moment I didn't guarantee Berlin for myself and instead counted on England to accept my support into Kiel.  And then England TOTALLY fucked my game up.  Italy going after Sevastopol instead of Turkish or Austrian dots didn't help either, and neither did you galavanting into fucking Ukraine for no good reason.", "I can't fucking believe people are getting paid to play in this game as a study on communication, and no body is fucking communicating.  Total shit show, but that's what you get when you recruit randoms off of reddit.", "Anyway, this has basically turned into a game of gunboat, with you going weeks between replying to my messages, Italy never responding, Germany never responding, Turkey never responding, and England never responding.", "And I fully expect to hear back from you sometime after Thanksgiving, based on your track record.  And, you'll probably fucking lie to me again and screw your own position up even more in the process - since that seems to be your preferred style of play this game.", "The game has been rocky for everyone. I stopped responding to you on purpose at the start and then shifted into a screw out after Italy didn\u2019t do anything for three turns", "So, what are you doing with Ukraine?  Right now I have Moscow supporting it to Warsaw, let me know please.", "I'm also supporting myself into Bulgaria, I suggest you use Bulgaria to take Greece.  Or cover Budapest.  Your call.   I'd like to finish off Turkey in this go around if you please.", "So, to wrap things up ... I've offered you support into Warsaw and  asked you to work with me against Turkey ... and your response has been that we need to start working together.  But, you haven't indicated in any way shape or form what you plan on doing or what you'd like to do together.  So, basically ... I'm in the same god damned situation with respect to trying to work with you, in which I've proposed things we can do together, asked for your help or feedback, and received nothing but silence in a game where you are getting PAID TO TALK.  What the actual @!#%, man?", "I have to hit Gal because of Germany. I can not move into War from Ukr because of the retreat order.

Is it suppourting CON to hold?", "what front?", "GErmany is already past the stalemate line.", "you can't actually slow him down.", "Are you formally included in the Franco German alliance? If not, then that\u2019s a front. He\u2019s about to move units into position to take Mos", "FRance is already past the stalemate line.  you can't actually slow him down either.  What we need to so, in order to survive this game, is to consolidate and defend what we can.", "If I can get another build, and you can get another build, then we can actually slow Germany down.  My build would come from CON and yours would come from Greece.  Can your unit in Bulgaria support me from BLA-CON?", "I still don't think we can stop him, but we can slow him down and maybe get France to attack him.  THEN the game opens wide", "And ... I forgot to click submit on my orders update. \ud83d\ude1e", "But.   You supported con to hold. Fuck you, bro. I\u2019ll throw the solo to Germany if I can.", "Cool", "Oh, ha!  There's only one game year left.  None of this shit actually matters.", "We get paid either way and I think the gm said something about a minimum of five centers because of the chat snafu.", "I mean, I'm a little pissed off that you've lied to me since 1902, but ... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "minimum of five centers?", "Mostly just ghosted you.

Obviously you can keep things to yourself if you wish", "I don\u2019t have any information on the north, but depending on what you\u2019ve heard about the Italians, I might be able to make some informed guesses about the north\u2019s fate, which I could/would share with you in exchange for that info.", "Italy didn\u2019t give me anything to be honest with you but he may in the future.

I\u2019ll let you know if I hear anything about the north", "Silence from Turkey, Russia is aggressive, and Italy is still a mystery. Those three things make me think juggernaut. What are your thoughts?", "Italy seems to be playing it slow or not sharing their thoughts, either way a smart way to play Italy since it\u2019s a little weaker.

I collapse, Turkey gets a navy, France gets bored and pushes the med to stop turkey, and Italy gets trapped in the middle.", "Seems like kind of a dummy.

If it is so, is there anything you can do to stop it?", "Yeah, France confirmed that it is true. That means he\u2019s probably committed to moving F Bre - MAO, and that you could take the channel. At a minimum, you can use the channel as leverage for Bel.", "Yes I have heard that he is forcing Bur, why\u2019re you worried about France though?

Also, Russia is planning on moving into the Carpathians and Hungary, and Turkey\u2018s build, in my opinion, can only mean that Turkey is not concerned with Russia, because Turkey\u2019s right flank is now completely exposed.\nIf you can provide token assistance to Germany and hold Irish and the channel, then you can probably convoy to the north and push on Russia up there while most of Russia\u2019s units fight with me. I think this is in our best interests because France dominating the seas isn\u2019t compatible with England in the long run, and a Turkey Russia alliance is quite difficult to stop.", "I don\u2019t want to go against russia right now, I think me doing so is merely in your best interest", "OK.

I wish you luck with the French fleet.", "Of course, if they seem to be a massive threat then I will respond", "France is moving fleets around Spain and getting in position to stab.

It is happening and they are set to reach the stalemate before you all can even get close to resolving the west", "Yes but there isn\u2019t anything I can do, germany is too irrational to side with me after I initially sided with France against him.

Trying to figure out what you\u2019re thinking so that we can work together.", "a) I think it's bullshit that in a game where we're being compensated to communicate with each other, you ignore me for an entire season.\nb) do you even look at the board before you put in your orders?  You're not getting any of my dots, brother.  And France is about to take at least two off of you.", "Well I\u2019m going to lose this game anyways, so :  a) Just because I didn\u2019t chat with you doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t talk with others. B) Im fairly new to diplomacy and never played as Italy before. Honestly just brute-forced the Lepanto because of a lack of creativity on my part. Sorry to be an annoying neighbor. Best of luck moving forward", "Well, if they give bonus points for honesty, you just got some.  Anyway, if you had partnered with me and moved on Trieste, you'd be getting a build right now.  Sometimes you need to adjust your game based on the conditions on the board.  Also, as Italy, I never Lepanto.   Well, never say never ... but the convoy to Syrna?  There's got to be a specific set of circumstances that result in that.   And France not being aggressive and Austria letting me have Trieste are two of them.", "You live and you learn", "Or you read one of the dozens of strategy articles for Italy that are on the internet.", "And, out of curiosity, why or who were you talking to while ignoring me?  You coordinated absolutely none of your moves with anybody else and somebody convoyed into your home territory.  I'd say you invested your diplomacy down a dry hole, brother.", "So ... another French Fleet.", "Yeah... Obviously I don't trust him, but he says it's going to be used to attack England", "I suppose no matter what he told me, I'd tell you that he's attacking you.  \n\nBut he's going to keep attacking you.", "Right", "You need a 5th build, and I border both Greece and Trieste.  Maybe you can get your 5th build from one of them and I could help you out?  I'm just worried that you're going to cripple me while France cripples you.  But if we can work together against a common neighbor, then we can both gain.", "Maybe I\u2019ll go for Tri. I think that Austria and Germany were trying to coordinate to push back at Russia in Vie. I\u2019ll try to gather more info from Austria if that\u2019s still in the works- might be able to get to Tri easily while he\u2019s preoccupied with that", "You will probably want to cover Rome.  I'm hoping that you convoy back to your peninsula so that you can defend your home centers.  I don't know how you're going to cover everything - If I was France i would probably see if you're going to stalemate me or not.  If you don't stalemate me, then I'll take everything I can.  If you do, then I'll re-posture towards Germany.", "But, regardless, I'm going to protect my home centers from you.  So, I'd ask you not to dedicate 3 out of your 4 units to get one of my home dots while, in the process, you lose two of yours.", "Yeah that sounds reasonable", "Agreed, it sounds reasonable.  I just hope that you are reasonable! \ud83d\ude42", "Wow, brother.", "You'll lose one center to him, at least.  I really don't understand your play.", "Actually, you'll lose two.  You'll lose Trieste and Tunis.  You jackass.", "I had a deal with France (risky, I know)", "Are you new to this game? I\u2019m trying to understand who I\u2019m negotiating with. You\u2019re making \u201cbeginner\u201d mistakes and if you\u2019re a beginner, that\u2019s ok - I can help you see other options and improve overall. My games is basically ruined, and while I\u2019m not going to give you my dots, I can help you in other ways. \n\nYour call.", "Yeah I am. Also it\u2019s finals week so I haven\u2019t been able to dedicate time to strategize, etc", "Did you have any input? Honestly open to it", "If I convoy Syr to Gre, would you be willing to support me into Greece?", "I would, yes.", "What is fleet Greece doing?", "Ok. Sorry for the late conversation but I\u2019m flying to Iowa tonight. I\u2019ll plan on supporting you to Greece. Let me know if you change your mind so that I don\u2019t waste my moves.", "Thank you!", "I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll end up doing with fleet Greece, but I will keep you updated next season. High likelihood I\u2019ll just have to convoy it back home", "Have a safe trip", "I assume you mean army Greece. \ud83d\ude0a", "Oops! Yes that\u2019s what I meant", "I hope so ....", "Yes 100%. I was rereading your previous message asking about fleet Greece", "Ohhh. I meant Fleet Agean!! Ha, it\u2019s so easy to make these mistakes!", "I can tell you stories ...", "Oh! Haha", "Words are hard", "Oh, misorders around Bulgaria have cost me in big moments.", "F Aeg was supposed to be used to support me into Smy as of last year- but Austria hasn\u2019t replied to anything this season", "Not sure if he\u2019s purposefully avoiding me or just given up", "A little column a, a little column b probably", "what would you like me to build?", "I don\u2019t have a preference at the moment", "Ok, here's my pitch to you - I can replace your fleet with one that I build, but I can't replace your army in Greece.  So, I'll build a fleet and ask you to disband the one in Eastern Med.  Then, we'll work together to get you into Trieste, which will make up for losing Rome and give you a shot at getting Venice back.  Otherwise, you're just going to get caught in the sandwich between France and me, with a dying Austria trying to get back into things.", "Ok, that sounds good to me. I have my order in to disband EAS. \n\nSince I didn\u2019t retreat into Tri, I\u2019m trying to leverage that into some coordination from Austria on their way out.  Not holding my breath though, but will keep you posted", "Oh .... i don't think that's salvageable.  But ... maybe?", "Yeah, doubtful....Stranger things have happened though haha", "Ok, I'll support you into Albania?", "Yeah thanks. A Gre?", "I have a final exam this evening, so I probably won't be on again until tonight, FYI", "yes.", "i've ordered it.", "What's your plan with Bul", "?", "I am hesitant to leave Greece wide open while I'm still so vulnerable to France at home", "I was going to pass through Greece and hopefully you\u2019ll convoy me to Apulia?

But if you\u2019re willing to work with me against France, I won\u2019t take your dots unless I need to in order to prevent France from getting them.", "let me know what you would like to do.", "True. Let's stick with the plan then. I have orders in for Greece to albania, and F ION will be ready for a convoy", "hopefully he doesn't dislodge it.  If he does, you should retreat to Adriatic, in my opinion.", "I must have forgotten to update the orders.

I need 4 fleets defending against you, plus 2 armies to ensure that I hold Trieste.  I also have a unit on the front line with Germany.  That leaves literally one unit, A CON, that is available to do anything anti-Russian, and it literally can't reach a Russian center this year.  However, if I get 2 builds off of Italy, they become two armies and wham, bam, I'm in UKR and ARM and he's fucked.", "So, I need for Russia to be the only one on the line with Germany and that army that's in Bohemia to be in Venice .

So yeah, we need to balance of power this.  Maybe you also vacate Tunis to take the solo off the table.  I know that you want to get a solo victory, so i understand if you decide that this isn't the path you want to take.  But, if you're genuine about you and me two-waying this thing - i've laid out the path.", "In principle i\u2019m not against our balancing power, nor am I fixated on soloing, but hear me out on this: unless I go barrelling into tyrolia\u2014which I won\u2019t and you\u2019d have at least two turns of warning if i did\u2014you only need trieste to hold trieste. If you build an army in smyrna (on the pretense of convoying it somewhere) then you can walk into sevastopol next year. As an initial stab you will almost certainly be able to take Vienna with bohemia and trieste, followed by budapest with help from albania having moved to serbia. That\u2019s russia down to two dots and you up to 11 with nary a cession from me. Meanwhile germany would be fending me off, so you\u2019d not have to worry about german attacks on old-austria. \nI\u2019m still pretty inexperienced at this game, so if there\u2019s some obvious issue here i\u2019m not seeing just tell me. But surely you can understand my hesitance to give up so much without first seeing any proof of loyalty from you.", "Thank you for the honest response.  So, I'm more experienced than you - didn't say better player - and I've seen a lot of games.  You're at 12 and the 6 you need for a solo you have relatively easily (if we don't work together on the other side of the board).  EDI, HOL, and - with the fleets you have available - DEN, SWE, NOR, and STP.   That's assuming no gains in mainland germany.  So, this means that Germany and Russia are going to need to work together in the north to stop you - which I'm willing to allow, unless you let me take the Italian dots.  \n\nAlso, I've already built A CON.  We're in Spring moves.", "Wow that was a short winter! But with all three italian dots plus bud, ven, sev, (all attainable by you in two years if i hand over italy) all *you\u2019ll* need to solo is the remains of russia and one other dot. And italy isn\u2019t exactly splittable, not with you and me so flush with fleets. \n...how about this: we illustrate our commitment this spring by each overtly stabbing our allies and making no moves against each other or into the ionian. Then in fall I\u2019ll let you into venice and start moseying out of italy, and shift my focus northward. So you\u2019d be pretty much guaranteed three dots this year and the remaining two italian dots next year, meanwhile I\u2019ll be doing what I can to break even.", "Ok.

I\u2019ll fight you extra hard out of spite", "Why?", "Why not try to get the best result possible? Why respond like a petulant child?", "Like I said, I don\u2019t really play this game much. I don\u2019t see a path to victory with you *and* germany against me so I might as well just act to make sure your dishonesty goes unrewarded", "What dishonesty?", "I was straight up with you about those dots being conditional for me to attack Russia.", "I made an offer in which you would get them, conditional on making a move against russia and not attacking me in spring. You said \u201cok\u201d and then proceeded to not move against russia and to move against me instead. This gaslighting is actually vile", "I\u2019m literally as close as I could get with A Con.

It's pretty shitty that you've gone radio silent and pretty disrespectful to the organizer of the game. //\n\nI'm going to easily take Naples and might be able to grab Tunis when it's all said and done.  But that's as far as I can go.  Why don't you just walk away, build a defensible line, and focus on grabbing those 3-4 supply centers in the north?", "which, as I recall, has been my pitch to you the past two weeks.", "It would bother me too much to just roll over and let someone who has lied to me and, when confronted, gaslit about it rather than apologize get what they want. \nI would have been happy to accommodate you if you had reciprocated my honesty.", "You have demonstrated remarkably thin skin this game.  Success in Diplomacy relies on adjusting to the conditions of the current game state, reading the board, making reasonable requests based on the game state, not reading into other people's responses what you want to see versus what they probably mean, etc.  I opened with pitching for a 3-way split from the get go.  Literally in 1902 or 1903, and we said let's revisit it in 1907.  You're the one who said that they wanted a solo, and then you get upset when I say \"ok\" when you ask me to do something that would give you the best chances of attaining it?  GTFOH!  \n\nI guess you can call that gaslighting.  I call it applying years of experience and calling a spade a spade.\n\nMoving on, which is all I've been trying to do, you need - at most - one more fleet in the south beyond your MAR, TYS, and TUN - which I assume will be your Fleet in LVP headed south.  That leaves your remaining seven units (didn't include the A PIE)  to hold Russia in check and take Scandinavia.  I'd be willing to NOT put any additional pressure on you in the South if that makes you feel more comfortable, but - in all honesty - your solo chance is done.  Let's play for the best possible result moving forward, and that's a three-way with no remaining Germany.", "You\u2019re right that I should have read the board rather than reading what I wanted to into your response. That was a valuable lesson for me. Here\u2019s one for you: you don\u2019t always get what you want.\nI don\u2019t care about an extra five dollars, so it makes no difference to me whether a stray power is left on the board\u2014that\u2019s your obsession.

I keep telling you, for me that means not rewarding asshole behavior.", "I haven't been an asshole.  You're the one accusing me of lying and then trying to gaslight you.

Clearly things worked out swimmingly between you and England, and Italy I'm sure was your best friend there at the end of the game.  I, on the other hand, have had a game-long and productive partnership with my ally.  Maybe, in all of this, I'm not the asshole?  Maybe you take a long look in the mirror and, if being a good neighbor and telling the truth is how you judge assholeness in your book, consider what your neighbors had to say about you as they exited this game instead of the guy who said \"we can two way if you give me Italy\" and you said \"no, attack Russia and we'll split the dots\" and I replied with \"ok.\"", "What it looks like to me is, you were planning on getting a solo in this game and things didn't work out the way you wanted them to.

For you to act as if that doesn\u2019t constitute a betrayal is ludicrous to me.\n\nI\u2019m not saying i play this game like a patron saint. I lie and backstab just like anyone. The difference between you and me, besides our skill and experience level, is that when I betray someone i don\u2019t turn around and act as if i haven\u2019t.

Way more than getting called a name.", "I'm generally an honest guy and genuinely interested in working with people to achieve mutually beneficial results.  What I'm not good at, and clearly I need to improve on, is working with people who are thin-skinned.  After my first go-around at this, and I was put into a game of Redditors who stopped talking to each other after 1902, I was told that I was being put into a pool of experienced players.

Also known as a pause filler or hesitation form.

I will refrain from using 'ok' when responding in this and other online forums.  I honestly didn't think I had agreed to your suggestion and got defensive when you accused me of lying.

If you\u2019re not going to turn on russia, you have quite successfully hemmed yourself in. \nI can\u2019t really even divert more resources to the north, since as you acknowledge I need those fleets for a defensive line in the med. so it\u2019s not as if detenting with you would allow me to divert more units toward eliminating germany.

If it\u2019s already established that you, me, and russia are the winners with no strays, what harm is there in you and me duking it out just to keep the game interesting?", "What I was/am trying to avoid is a scenario in which you (a) work with Germany and (b) send way more strength to the Med than you can actually use.  I was concerned, since I had continually offended you, that you were going to go full-on spite against me!  Since it would appear that you're not going to do that, ok.  As iron sharpens iron, I will fight you in the Med over the remaining dots!  Perhaps we'll both learn something!

I\u2019m experiencing a certain amount of jetlag", "That\u2019s understandable. I figured it was a bit of a mistake.

I mentioned to him that he could help you out in the north as that would benefit me (I like you and don\u2019t want France getting too big)", "Did he say anything?", "What have your conversations with France been like? Do you think France is allied with England?", "Yes I do, I am negotiating him getting that fleet out of Spain and he said he has to clear it with england.", "Yikes", "Yeah so you\u2019re in trouble, have you heard from russia or Austria?", "Yeah been talking to Russia. Austria, only a little", "Is russia gonna help or nah", "We\u2019ll see", "Hey Italy! How\u2019s it going?", "Some good some bad as I think you can see. Austria was being uncooperative so it was nice to coordinate a little hit on them. Unfortunately France got a little bold.", "Yes that is unfortunate. It seems to me that France and England are in lock step.", "I wanted to ask what your plans for that army in Tyr are", "Well with the French being aggressive I might have to support Ven holding (after I build) otherwise it\u2019ll probably be attacking Austria.", "Is France asking you about attacking England? He told me he would and I was curious whether or not he\u2019s being honest", "Yes he asked me!!", "Can I trust him?", "He has been extremely untrustworthy this game. I would recommend trying to work with him, but protect yourself as much as you can. Don\u2019t trust him in any places where it makes you vulnerable.", "But negotiating peace/an attack on England can\u2019t hurt", "Not saying to betray him at all, he has been a fantastic ally that I would love to end the game with but we should keep an eye on Russia\u2019s growth", "Yeah I\u2019m totally with you. Russia says he wants a three way victory with me you and him. I think the best thing we can do is build to parity", "Exactly, France is gonna try and get us to break off, I\u2019m good staying with russia for now though", "Agreed.", "If he helps me with turkey and Austria and actually gives me supply centers then I will have enough that he can\u2019t really stab both of us. Which is the point he made. If he\u2019s gonna go for a solo we will know this year", "I think our best bet is to ride this out, take Russia at his word, but be prepared to work together if he turns on one of us.", "Sounds great", "Lol", "Is france trying to recruit you?", "Yes, he said \u201cwe need to do something about Russia\u201d", "Yeah I\u2019m playing along with him right now, I\u2019m supposed to be convincing you that France is trustworthy", "Lolololololol", "He hasn\u2019t even convinced me that he\u2019s trustworthy so I don\u2019t know why he thinks I would do that \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah he\u2019s a real champ", "He\u2019s been so annoying all game", "And he wants me to ally with Austria and turkey, who have both already stabbed me this game", "Yes, just as France has also support england in stabbing me.", "He knows he\u2019s kinda beat. With Russia\u2019s support, France will be worn down over the next few years.", "Yeah he picked a bad ally and then that ally quit, I\u2019ll be turning to crush him once we deal with the East", "Amen. I\u2019m hoping to take many of his supply centers to establish some parity. I think the best thing we can do to keep the alliance strong is make sure we\u2019re all about the same size.", "Yeah that was the only reason I got a little worried is because he\u2019s now doubled us", "Hey Italy good looks!! Looks like england, Austria and turkey are virtually toast.", "Hey Italy! Wanted to check in and say hi! Things seem to being going really well for our alliance!", "Yeah I agree! I still wanna make sure that France doesn\u2019t become a threat, russia is playing nice", "Russia is been good to me, I\u2019m still weary of a stab", "How\u2019s it going Italy?! wanted to check in", "Pretty good! I\u2019ll be heading toward France here", "Epic. Let\u2019s carve them up.", "How are you feeling about Russia", "Good, he\u2019s been nice to me and has continued to support me", "Yeah I still trust him and feel good about the alliance", "Me too", "I think when Turkey is officially eliminated we be able to get France to surrender", "Yeah he\u2019s just starting to break", "And HAPPY NEW YEAR!

If you get the Turks to think you'll be on their side you might be able to get them to support your landing, but that's a long-shot.", "Because getting to 5 would be nice, I would actually have some options. But yeah we need contact from Austria.", "Yeah, the more time goes on the more I'm thinking of playing along with the Turks for at least long enough to dismantle them, but I really really don't want to do that.", "Yeah hopefully we hear from Austria soon just so that there are options for everyone (including Turkey)", "Yeah, them being AFK really forces a scramble for their territory.", "I\u2019m guessing they aren\u2019t actually AFK and have just not gotten on the discord yet. Although this is strange.", "If they do end up going AFK I would have to assume we would restart the game", "I certainly hope so, the game's never as interesting with one nation DOA.", "Any news on Austria?", "They just responded to my message, no big breakthrough but at least they're alive.", "Yeah same, gonna work on staying peaceful", "We agreed to leave Galicia empty, but the way they worded it makes me feel kinda on-edge about it. Hopefully they don't do anything that'll derail everything.", "We\u2019re leaving Tyr open, he must be planning on going after Turkey then", "Regardless, even if he does try something funny, I'll be in a position to counter it. Hopefully it's as you said.", "I will be too, not leaving Ven until he isn\u2019t an immediate threat", "Solid choice, no reason to move it unless the French start getting funny ideas.", "Which I doubt, that attack never works", "Yeah, it always leaves them too open to attack by the other two members of the Western Triple.", "Turkey is responding to Austria but hasn\u2019t responded to me, something to keep an eye on", "Well, if the Austrians were willing to tell you that then it's a good sign about whether or not we've got the Austrians on our side at the very least. Then again, if they're talking to each other it's bad news for me.", "If they both went after you I\u2019d probably intervene", "It would be too good of an opportunity", "There'd be plenty of openings for you to exploit, that's for sure, lol", "Exactly", "God Germany had me so goddamn worried about getting bounced in Sweden and they didn't even twitch toward Denmark this turn ffs", "Better than a potential bounce, I might try to find out what the alliance situation is in the western theatre. It looks like turkey might be scared of a Lepanto with his hold.", "He is, I'm communicating with him consistently, keeping him unaware that I'm not on his side. He's going to move to Armenia to build a fleet in Smyrna and he's going to pivot the Ankara fleet to Constantinople so that it can leave.", "Thank you for the information, I suppose I\u2019ll be needing to propose an attack on them with Austria then", "Any word on if the Austrians are letting you have Greece?", "I\u2019ll ask right now", "Are you getting much from Austria? They don\u2019t seem very chatty", "Austria is gonna take Gre", "Well that sucks. Not much to be done about it though.", "And yeah,  I haven't gotten much from Austria at all. Just a single volley of messages that one time in the first season.", "I just heard back from them again, they still trust you regarding Gal.", "Very good, though at this point they kinda have to.", "So what are your thoughts on Turkey? They will have 4 units after this year, and possibly be in BLA", "As long as the three of us (You, me, and to a lesser degree Austria) stay together, we can take them easily no matter how good their positioning.", "Do you want to start moving after this season then?", "Yes, I'll be making a move on them in the first season of the new year.", "We can try to coordinate with Austria but it\u2019ll probably be hard.", "I'm communicating with them as much as I can.", "It might be better to leave them out of it, not sure if we can trust them", "Yeah, the move to Vienna definitely indicates that they intend to build a fleet.", "Yeah, we have an arrangement where he moves out of Tri and I would move out of Ven when I saw that, however he\u2019s gonna build right back into Tri so that\u2019s a problem.", "What are your thoughts on Germany?", "Well, they seem like they're about to have a hard time if France and Britain are combined against them, which it seems they are.", "I was thinking about trying to become friendly with them, since France is not looking that friendly right now. Speaking of- do you think that I should be worried about that fleet going to the south coast of Spain? (plus they will be building in Mar)", "You probably should. I've currently got a working relationship with the Germans but I'm thinking of upgrading it to a full-on alliance given the France-Britain alliance that's unfolding.", "I was going to propose that you send a fleet or something over to help him against england.", "We\u2019re on the same page \ud83d\ude02", "Well, if you want to help out you could always start putting light pressure on them, not enough to provoke a reaction before we're finished with the Turks but enough to keep them from being able to full-focus the Germans", "Not sure what we get from Germany on this other than that england and France don\u2019t get too big too fast.", "Eh, we keep the French and British from growing out of control while we take Turkey out, then once we're ready we can cannibalize them I reckon.", "I don\u2019t know how much I can dedicate to both Turkey and France though. I\u2019m assuming we will want both my fleets on Turkey.", "Probably just an army to Pie", "Of course, Turkey needs to be destroyed ASAP, but even a slight distraction counts.", "The only problem being that once Turkey's gone, traditionally Austria starts either looking West or East for their next target, and we're on either side of that.", "At this point I think I\u2019d trust you enough to say this, and if I can\u2019t then I\u2019m probably screwed either way. But I think we should look to eat turkey up toward the end of our turkey campaign or else immediately after.", "They are not a reliable communicator and my armies need to go somewhere", "I was wondering how to broach that subject myself. I am absolutely in support, I think that we should limit Austria's gain to Bulgaria and once we've got Turkey on the ropes, turn and eliminate them as fast as possible so we can both pivot to the west.", "That sounds good to me, hopefully he is responsive enough that he is useful against Turkey", "As for how to split the Austria/Turkey gains we'll make, how's this sound?\nYou: Trieste, Smyrna, Serbia, Greece, and Bulgaria\nMe: Constantinople, Ankara, Vienna, and Budapest", "Constantinople of course so that my fleet can get out and contribute in the Med", "That sounds great.", "Have you proposed the thing to Germany, I\u2019ll vouch for you unless you don\u2019t want you and I working together to be too public", "I'd already agreed to help them by taking Norway and deploying my fleets to fuck with the Brits, I figure that as long as we keep cooperating along those lines then that's effectively an alliance, no need to be all formal about it. The two of you should definitely start to closely cooperate though.", "France made some interesting choices with that build. Normally building fleets in the north would be something that puts the British deeply on edge.", "Yeah I\u2019m kinda confused, glad they didn\u2019t build a fleet in Mar too.", "I\u2019m still gonna play cautious", "Even so, if they move precisely right they can guarantee that the German fleet in Belgium doesn't survive.", "Yeah it\u2019s not looking great for my guy germany over there, he\u2019s gonna need some help.", "Well, they can't kill the fleet in Belgium and keep Norway at the same time, but then again, if the Germans do as I asked they wouldn't be able to do either even if they prioritized Norway. Germany may not have the upper hand but they still have a decent position.", "Yeah I\u2019m gonna message england about that fleet in Bre and see what he says", "I think he anticipates me coming for Norway and that's the reason that he built a fleet in Edinburgh.", "Well we will see, if France moves that fleet in Spain back into the mid Atlantic (which would confuse me) things are gonna get messy.", "Maybe they figure that they can get to the British when they're out of position and grab up the majority of the supply centers before anyone can stop them?", "Yeah I really don\u2019t know what people are thinking over there, I\u2019ve tried to get a feel for the alliances (even by offering to exchange info) but haven\u2019t been able to crack them. According to germany, england was not supposed to do what they did (fairly obvious). It is possible that we have misread things though and england acted on their own. France did tell me they want to stay neutral until they trust someone. England sneak attacking Germany could have scared France, leading to the fleet build. This is obviously speculative though", "England slipped up with their language at one point and told me that they don't trust the French to *stay* allied with them if they don't keep them in check", "Just got that from England as well. He says he views the fleet as aggressive and unnecessary, and that France says they are *still* allies despite this. He is angry with France though so he told me that France is planning on attacking me with that mini force.", "Excellent, I'll work on the French to try and drive that wedge deeper.", "Should I hold off on messaging France? Wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing to make them think I\u2019m oblivious.", "They started playing their cards very close to their chest with me though so I don't know if they trust me anymore. If you can get them off guard as far as your skill goes I can definitely see that going to your advantage.", "I *definitely* don't like that the Austrians decided to build a fleet in Trieste. That doesn't indicate trust worthiness.", "Any chance at least one of your armies will be heading down to keep Austria honest?", "I wish that I had the armies to spare but with the Brits displaying some amount of suspicion I don't know if I can afford to have any fewer than 3 units up there.", "Hey, weird pitch, are you alright if I let slip to the French that the Brits might have given away some of their plans regarding you? It has a lot of potential to drive a wedge into that alliance.", "Yeah that\u2019s fine with me, I\u2019d like to keep France away from me. I\u2019m kind of worried about France and Austria teaming up on me, there wouldn\u2019t be much I can do", "Hopefully the revelation that their plans have been revealed will keep them off your back.", "That sounds great, I messaged Austria about going after Turkey, he said that he is interested but is more worried about France. That is reassuring to me though. Maybe you could reach out and try to figure out how we could do both?", "There's not much I can do about France without dealing with the British first, but the best thing that we could do for the time being is see to it that the Turks are eliminated.\n\nOn that note, I'm working a deep subterfuge with the Turks. This turn I'm going to support them to hold in Bulgaria while my fleet moves -with their consent no less- into the Black Sea; in fall I plan to convoy my army from Rumania to Constantinople; from there we can annihilate them completely, hopefully within the third year.", "That sounds great, by the way you have successfully pissed off france, he sent me a long message about how I will not be attacked and that I should trust him", "Excellent, driving that wedge deeper as we speak. Need them to decide that I'm a better partner than the British.", "Sounds great, I\u2019m still not sure about France so keep working on France to convince them not to attack me either", "Test message, I\u2019m not getting the thumb option", "Weird, wasn\u2019t working when I messaged england", "Yeah, it messes up from time to time. The French have assured me emphatically that they never had any plans to attack you to begin with, and have indicated a temptation to make a rush at Liverpool if I advance the front in Scandinavia.", "Interesting, does not seem like a solid alliance. We are working on demilitarizing the Mediterranean so that I I don\u2019t have to be worried", "I'm going to keep up the temptations, but I think that I've pushed hard enough at them for this season at least.", "Hopefully I can trust France after this", "One can certainly hope, in any case you'll be in decent position to counter them if they make a move toward you.", "Yeah unless austria does too, but I doubt that", "Austria seems earnest at the very least, but the glut of units they have that have to sit sedentary certainly puts me on edge.", "Yeah I was hoping to coordinate an attack with them, but I don\u2019t know now", "Destroying Turkey would be faster if they took Bulgaria in Fall, but I don't want to give them another build that has to sit around doing nothing.", "I was thinking about going ION -> AEG and NAP -> ION, I would go into EAS but I have a feeling Turkey will move there. Do you have any idea what their moves are from your spying?", "Yeah if they don\u2019t take it it isn\u2019t the end of the world", "I desperately need the Turkish move into the Aegean to not bounce so that I can convoy an army to Constantinople. I believe that they intend to move both fleets out at the same time, but I know for fact that they want to move into the Aegean with the fleet in Constantinople at the very least. I'd recommend bouncing the Eastern Med and moving the fleet in Naples out to the Tyrrhenian Sea so that if the French do move toward you you're in better position to stop it.", "Sorry, I had intended to make move recommendations and tell you what Turkey's plan was at the point where I told you that I was going to move an army to Constantinople but apparently I completely failed to do that.", "Okay that\u2019s fine, as long as things will work", "Unless the Turks catch on it should work like a charm.", "Sounds great, I may not move into the Tyrr just because of an agreement I made with France", "Fair, I'm just concerned that the agreement was only so that you wouldn't move while they put themselves into position.", "Yeah I\u2019ll keep an eye on it", "The Austrians are expressing doubt about my plan, I'm concerned that they think I'm proposing something that'll get them double-crossed. They're impatient for Bulgaria.", "That\u2019s understandable, I\u2019ll see what they say to me", "I'm mostly worried that they'll act alone or worse, make a move on me.", "I don\u2019t think so, they\u2019re a lot more worried about this France thing for some reason", "I can't imagine why, there's an entire Switzerland between the two of them.", "I know I don\u2019t get it", "Austria's gone rogue.", "Goddamnit they're going to ruin the entire offensive.", "Standby for possible drastic shift in allegiances.", "Yeah Austria is dumb", "How do you feel about shifting our plans to attack the Austrians instead?", "I was going to ask you the same thing", "You should start communicating with them, I've gotten them to agree to let you have Greece, you should talk to them about convoying there", "As in talk to turkey?", "Right yeah, if you hadn't started already I mean.", "Will do, I have to figure out my France thing too", "Yeah, it's not looking very much like a DMZ over there.", "We both agreed to move into those because we weren\u2019t sure what to do yet", "Sounds like the French are trying to maneuver themselves into some kind of position while feigning indecision.", "Yeah I\u2019m having him move out before I do", "Good idea.", "It\u2019d be good for me to get a build here though so that I can support myself", "Do you think it\u2019s too risky to go Ven -> Tyr", "Nah, if you can take the Austrians by surprise and nab two supply centers at once, so much the better, especially since you could immediately build in venice after that.", "Tyr isn\u2019t a supply center", "Thhhbt got it mixed up with Trieste in my head; still, if you succeed to take Greece it'd be a hugely powerful play", "Plus he hasn\u2019t attack Ven all game", "Hopefully he doesn't take you for a turncoat", "Yeah I\u2019m gonna try and butter him up a little by saying I\u2019m worried about you and turkey", "Speaking of, I have a feeling turkey doesn\u2019t like me, especially after that bounce. Are you sure he\u2019ll support me into Gre?", "I've given them the sweet talk about how it's all temporary and we'll kill you later blah blah so I think they're sufficiently convinced to do it.", "Okay because me getting Gre doesn\u2019t really leave him with anything of Austria", "They've told me that they're willing to accept that so long as you're going to be an immediate target. Obviously I'm reassuring them as to that fact but intend ASAP to execute the plan that I had had in mind before Austria ruined my attack plan.", "Because I think that plan was sweet and I'm pissed that I didn't get to do it.", "Hahahaha it was sweet, austria should go down quick though. I\u2019d say the only variables are if Turkey gets their fleet too far out it will slow me down and if France gets aggressive", "With the builds I get from Austria, if all goes right, I should be able to crush Turkey with no more support from you than is necessary to claim your fair share of builds to use on the French front. Hopefully.", "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Also worried about if Turkey doesn\u2019t play ball, but you have to take risks sometimes", "Yeah, hopefully we go 2/3 for risky alliances. (The second successful case being the Germans thusfar.)", "That\u2019s my favorite part about the Italy/Russia alliance. It\u2019s very mutually beneficial and doesn\u2019t take much risk.", "The only problem being that in the early game it's very difficult to mutually support", "This is true", "Soon enough we'll be able to though, hopefully.", "Yeah if austria goes down", "Oh my god, Austria has no idea how this game even works.", "Apparently they betrayed me because \"They knew I was up to something because there's no way that they could have taken Bulgaria\" but... it's pretty obvious that they could, Greece goes to Bulgaria, Serbia supports, F Ionian breaks the Aegean's support. I'm so fucking frustrated.", "That\u2019s very annoying, who told you that austria?", "The Austrians themselves told me that, yes.", "I meant to say turkey", "Ah, no, the Austrians themselves admitted that that's the reason they betrayed me last turn, they were talking about twenty minutes ago.", "Turkey is being cagey about letting me into Gre, can you prod or at least find out if they\u2019re gonna do it", "Will do my best", "They say yes, that that is the plan. Was a very brief message though.", "Yeah he said he\u2019s supporting me in", "What\u2019re your moves this round? Just curious how things are gonna work. I\u2019ll share mine too if it makes you uncomfortable", "Good good, and he's supporting the convoy from Tunis, yes?", "Yes", "I'm going to protect Warsaw and do everything I can to hold onto Rumania. I fed the Austrians some bullshit lines trying to get them to back off and focus on the Turkish threat, hopefully that'll work. Black Sea's going to support Rumania to hold and Ukraine's moving to Warsaw.", "Yeah I have austria supporting me into the Aegean with Gre so that\u2019ll be a wasted move", "I\u2019m gonna hold in TYS and move into Tyr", "Good, can you get them to tell you what they'll be doing with the rest of their units? I need to know whether to defend Warsaw or Rumania.", "I\u2019m gonna try and get turkey to hit Ser to cut any potential support", "Yeah I\u2019ll ask", "Thanks, I'll admit it's got me anxious.", "Are you too worried about Rum to let Bul hit Ser to cut support?", "Or do you think we don\u2019t need to worry, he won\u2019t support Gre holding", "There's too many risks if you ask me. If the Austrians supported from Greece to Bulgaria we'd get Greece but the Turks would lose Bulgaria and we'd have a shit time. I don't think he'll try to support Greece holding.", "Yeah I\u2019m realizing that he won\u2019t either.", "Any specifics? The most important one is what he'll do with Galicia.", "I\u2019m thinking about going TYS to Tus, I don\u2019t think France will move into TYS if they stab because they should expect me to hold. I\u2019m guessing they would convoy or move into Tus and Pie right?", "Yeah I haven\u2019t heard back yet, I\u2019m just guessing he won\u2019t support Gre because he doesn\u2019t have a reason to", "That seems the most likely option, I think it's a good idea to do that. The French have the opportunity to ruin you completely if they manage to secure both.", "Yeah I\u2019m worried about that, not sure what else I can do other than send Ven to Pie but I wanna get moving on austria", "The faster them and Turkey are destroyed the faster you can pivot completely toward the French. I just wish I could convince France that the English were a better option.", "Yeah they\u2019re pretty annoying", "Just like the real French", "Hey now, I happen to quite like the French in reality lol", "Just messing around", "I gotcha, the France in this game definitely has their general aloofness down pat for sure though", "They\u2019re very difficult to negotiate with. They are saying that me being in LYO is more risky for them than them being in TYS is for me", "That's a stinking lie and they know it.", "Exactly", "France all of the sudden agreed, pretty suspicious", "Extremely. Don't trust them.", "Moving into Tus is a win win, either I\u2019m prepared for the attack or we both move out of the spaces and the DMZ is active", "Yea gods if only the Austrians hadn't been chief among morons we'd be in such a better spot.", "This will be a big turn", "Indeed, this is big make-or-break time.", "Yeah we\u2019re taking a lot of risks. France and Austria could attack me, Turkey could screw us up.", "Hell, if the British get tricky again the Germans may not recover.", "Yeah they\u2019re worried about england holding Hol, otherwise england might not recover", "Well if England fails to recover, we might have a shot at this yet.", "It\u2019ll be interesting", "You have no idea how much information you can get from some people if you feign a willingness to betray an ally. The English have effectively handed the war in the north to me, if they're telling the truth, and if they aren't, it proceeds as normal anyways.", "What\u2019d they say???", "With the \"promise\" to betray the Germans in a turn's time they've agreed to back away from St. Petersburg, told me a great deal of France's plans, and given me an opening to break through their fleets, if all goes according to plan.", "And if they're lying, then nothing of value was lost.", "So what\u2019re france\u2019s plans?", "And nice work", "I only got information as pertains to Germany unfortunately; they're allegedly not going to menace Munich but instead throw all their support against Belgium.", "Nice, should help you and germany our!", "Out!", "I certainly hope so! Any blow struck against the British and French is a possible relief to you.", "Yeah I\u2019m really hoping France doesn\u2019t hit me and I get Gre", "That would be the ideal situation. I shudder to think of the worst-case this turn though.", "I might have to stay up and see what happens", "I have no choice but to either way, I'm busily researching for a big paper I have to write by the end of the week.", "College?", "Yeeeeep, it's a real pain in the ass.", "It really is", "I\u2019m in finals this week", "Same, though it's mostly over. I had two today.", "Same I\u2019m done tomorrow, I\u2019m at MSU", "IUPUI myself.", "Good stuff", "Well prayers up for good grades and good luck with France", "I'll drink to that.", "Aside from France making a move on you, I could not be happier with the results.", "True", "Ok, so, if the French weren't riding your ass we could make amazing progress this year, but unfortunately they are. Unfortunately as well, the Turks are rearing to get at you too; I'll convince them otherwise, and if we make sufficient progress (Unfortunately the only way I envision it working is if the Turks get Serbia for now, similar with how the Austrians would have gotten Bulgaria) I will be in Budapest, and if things go *really* well, I'll stab the Turks before year's end to keep their minds off of you. If the French back off we can easily get you Trieste and then start making serious gains on your front.\n\nHow's that sound as far as a general road map goes? Considering the situation I think that it would also be far more expedient for us to switch Smyrna for Vienna in our center shares but I understand if you'd prefer to stick with what we had planned previously.", "Yeah I already told turkey they could have Ser, it was part of negotiating Gre. And yes France is really ruining things, I could lose Ven if they coordinate with Austria (which is probably somewhat unlikely since Austria has stabbed everyone so far this game)", "I\u2019m not sure if we will need to switch those, but I am open to figuring it out when the time comes", "Even if they do coordinate, the only way they can guarantee it is by moving with the fleet in the Adriatic this turn, and you can take it back immediately after that if the Turks and I work together to disrupt the hell out of them.\n\nThe current worst case is that the French can now support the convoy move into Tuscany.", "I\u2019ll be building an army in Ven which will help with everything", "It will indeed. Things are going to be extremely rough if the French don't decide that they need to pull back.", "Yeah hopefully you can convince them", "I\u2019ll be arguing it too", "You could also try to tell the Austrians that if they're going to be cool now that you'll back off, but they seem fully in league with the French.", "Maybe try to convince them to disband Adriatic rather than Albania?", "Worth a shot", "I moved into Tyr though", "Well if they do that, you can support Tyr into Piedmont and send TYS to Tus, and that would not only block the French convoy again, but force the French to retreat. It's worth a shot.", "Yeah I\u2019ll see", "Hang on, let me pitch it as \"Getting the Italians to back off\" rather than as you offering, it might be that they trust me more since they backed off of Galicia when I asked.", "That\u2019s fair", "As soon as they respond I'll tell you what they said. That would be a godsend in backing the French away, even if it'd be a setback on the Austrian front; I'm more worried about the French, don't know about you.", "I am too, I can\u2019t fight on two fronts", "As long as you hold the French off and and I can hold the Turks back long enough to put them down easy, it shouldn't be *too* much of a crisis. And here I thought the sweating would be over after last season's results, silly me.", "It\u2019ll be interesting for sure \ud83d\ude02", "Hopefully the pressure that I'm about to lay down in the north will be enough to get the French concerned and pull back.", "I\u2019m still trying to figure out if there\u2019s a way to split the england France alliance. Not sure who would be more likely to attack who but either way it would cause the French to retreat.", "Soon enough I'll have the English on the ropes if everything goes as I intend it to. That would definitely cause the French to need to reassess the situation.", "France sounds a little apologetic and defeated, could be a ruse but I\u2019m hopeful", "It is 100% a ruse, don't believe them for a second.", "Hahaha I would never move differently because of it. Just hoping it is followed by a retreat", "What\u2019re you doing for your build?", "That'd be super cool. I asked the Turks if I was allowed to build in Sevastopol, because I want to convoy from there to one of their home supply centers when the time comes.", "I obviously didn't tell them that last part.", "Hahahahaha, we\u2019ll see what they say then", "The Austrians did it the mad bastards, they deleted the fleet in the Adriatic!", "Hahaha did you suggest that?", "I did indeed, didn't expect it to work but here we are!", "Wonderful, that will make defense easier", "For me", "Well, it means that you can support yourself into Piedmont and make it impossible to lose Venice, at least not until next year.", "The only hurdle is determining whether or not the French are going to try to convoy again, or try a different plan of attack.", "Yeah it\u2019s gonna be tough I\u2019m gonna have to play cautious", "Lol France is out here trying to get me to let him into Tyr", "FOH", "\ud83d\ude02", "This fucking guy lol", "Like, what kind of wacky races plan does he think he's gonna pull off?", "He claimed it would be low risk", "I told him low risk is him turning around and attacking England", "If you want turkey to take Ser then you should hit Bud, I\u2019m supporting him in.", "I think you should, we will have turkey in a corner and he trusts you it\u2019s okay if he gets a build as long as it comes from Austria", "I'm attacking Budapest as my part yeah.", "Though, doesn't supporting him have the same effect with less rksk?", "True, either way works", "The fucking people I\u2019m this game good god", "*in", "God the Turks ugh", "You could have had Ionian support Greece, not that it would have mattered", "Took a big risk trusting the French to back off", "I realized that even if they didn\u2019t back off I would be able to respond", "And yeah I should have had the support in, I was changing my orders last minute and didn\u2019t fix that. But yeah it would not have mattered", "What do you want from Tri", "If you could support me into Budapest, from there I can support you into effectively all of the territories you need from Austria/Turkey, aside from Greece and Bulgaria.", "I'm moving from Galicia, sorry, that's necessary information.", "Will do!", "Turks are gonna be pissed when they see the news.", "Good work, lots of builds for you I will have to catch up. Kind of sucks that england quit", "It does, but considering how things were going for them I don't exactly blame them, especially since the French were just about to turn coat.", "So which do you want first? Vienna or Serbia?", "Not sure yet, cleaning this up is gonna be a mess.

I'm guessing the Turks are going to withdraw both fleets to Smyrna and Constantinople respectively, but if you have the Ionian poke the Aegean and I have Rumania poke Bulgaria I can guarantee that my fleet makes it into Constantinople, and from there we can guarantee your fleet makes it into the Aegean, from there you'll have Smyrna and at the same time you'll have armies marching into Greece and Bulgaria if all goes well.", "I was thinking about negotiating a mutual retreat with France and then being sneaky and moving into WES, could slow them down.

Bulgaria and Greece are both walk-ins now. I'll start pulling away from our border in Austria and the Balkans.", "Yeah looking good!", "From what I can tell we don\u2019t need to coordinate anything this season", "Not particularly, things are going quite well.", "I can support you into Bulgaria just in case the Turks unexpectedly submit orders though", "Sounds good", "Think it's time to pivot toward the French, I can support your fleet

great!", "I think when Turkey is eliminated we may be able to get France to surrender", "Probably yes", "Happy New Year, I'm going to be forcing my way into the Mid-Atlantic, from there I can support you into Spain; you'll probably end up being the one of us with 12 supply centers at the end considering the positioning of everything.", "Sounds wonderful, happy new year to you as well", "Shall we

I\u2019m not trying to start a fight with austria immediately either.", "I realize this may be alarming to you, but I quite honestly do not want to attack you, in my experience a Lepanto is a lot better deal for Austria than Italy.

I have not. One reason I\u2019m moving the way I am is because I have some interest in Gre, however I\u2019m not going to try and sneak/force my way in there.

I was trying to get my army involved in things", "I guess a convoy to Albania would be possible, but then we might have to delay taking Greece hmm", "Yeah I\u2019m trying to get that army involved and take a SC this turn because it\u2019s fall.

I think that would guarantee it can\u2019t support Gre holding or an attack on Rum", "Do you think that would work", "I'm a bit nervous about losing bul to be honest", "And I don't think the Russians would be super pleased either", "I\u2019m just trying to guarantee that I get Gre you know?", "Is there a good way to do it?", "Yea, I feel you", "Gre is supporting me into the AEG (obviously I\u2019m not gonna actually move that way) so that takes away one thing", "Austria also has been talking to me about attacking Russia, so maybe I can leverage that", "Yeah if you could get him to support Bul to Rum, then we would know that he\u2019s not attacking you or Russia (because obviously you won\u2019t actually attack Rum)", "I think he'd probably want to me to support him at this point, while I would in theory be able to take Sev, but I'm not sure that helps us", "Cuz that could just free up Ser even more yknow", "Alright, I'll be back online in a few hours -- have to go give an exam",

Are you planning to attack Austria early, or thinking of the standard move of: \nF Naples - Ionian\nA Rome - Naples\nA Venice H", "Yeah I\u2019m not planning on going for Austria off the bat, I feel like it usually just locks the two weakest countries into a fight that hurts us both", "Understood, good to know!", "Seems like everything went pretty much according to plan. Not sure why Turkey stayed in Smy instead of backfilling to Con. Seems a bit passive to me.", "He\u2019s scared of me pulling off a lepanto. What\u2019s the deal for you guys, seems like you and england have an agreement at the very least to stay out of ENG.

My priority is securing Burgundy, and that's why I built the army.", "I had heard that, and was already suspicious. Your fleet going to SC of Spain was alarming. Him telling me that made it worse. The only way I will believe you is if your fleet moves back into the Atlantic.", "However there isn\u2019t much I can do to attack you, only defend.", "In my view, the fleet going to SC of Spain is a concession to England, but apparently he doesn't see things the same way.

Additionally, you are in a very good position to defend those centers if I were to move into LYO. So I propose that I hold in TYS and you move from LYO to Spa SC, (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re moving Spa to Gas) and when I see that I will leave TYS and our DMZ will be in effect.", "Hmmm... Can I assume that F Ionian will be going east, against either Turkey or Austria?", "How is your relation with Austria, actually?", "The situation with Germany and England has become very messy and delicate.

The relationship is good though", "Has Austria been responsive to you?", "They haven't really responded to me, for the most part", "What is messy and delicate about it?

Not really the other way around though it\u2019s impressive that you pulled that off.", "I think the dynamic does matter a bit, but I think as soon as Germany gambled hard for Belgium it made it very difficult to come to a deal with them", "Yeah that was weird by him. He was upset about england moving into Hol but like it was open", "It was a really strange early game in general", "Even as the main beneficiary of early conflict between England and Germany, I wasn't quite sure what to make of it", "Naughty naughty", "Hehehe worth a shot", "I had a pretty terrible turn all around... Was putting in moves at 2am central europe time and ended up with a bunch of misorders", "Not gonna pretend I put in a convoy order by accident though", "I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll realize you have bigger fish to fry and head back?", "There would be no hard feelings", "Will need to figure out how to recover from that misorder, in general", "England isn\u2019t looking too good, russia tricked him last round and now he\u2019s kinda screwed", "I\u2019m getting a build in case you needed another reason to back off", "Yeah, I'm not on top of my game right now, but I did notice your build and England's dilemma", "Alright, I put some thought into it, I think we can turn this around into a mutually beneficial arrangement", "I would like your permission to go to Tyrolia", "From there, I can break through Germany's line in Munich, and also support you into Austria", "I don't think there's too much risk on your end from being stabbed - that unit would be really isolated from the rest of my forces", "If you agree, suggest that you do A Venice - Piedmont - Tyrolia and send A Tyrolia - Bohemia", "I\u2019m not going to do that, the only benefits are things I could do myself.", "Why do you not realize that england is an easier and better target for you?", "You can get his SCs well before russia does", "You have a point, actually, especially since this fight against Germany is going nowhere", "Let me speak to Germany about it", "I know I\u2019m biased but I think he\u2019s a lot easier target than I am or Germany is", "Part of why I sided with him over Germany is that he seemed more competent. But this is going nowhere, time to reconsider", "Yeah you have been strangely loyal to him", "I don't think it was a mistake to side with England at the start, but I think I should have cut my losses earlier instead of not only sticking with him, but also opening a second front against you", "Still waiting to hear back from Germany, but Russia is on board and that's good enough for me. Germany has reason not to trust me and it might be good to make a demosntration of good faith anyways", "I'll draw down A Pie - Mar", "Would like to demilitarize Pie going forward, although it would be understandable if there are some hard feelings there", "Yeah we can build a DMZ once you have pulled out", "Okay now we need to figure out TYS and LYO", "I'm perfectly content to just stay as is, to be honest. We could also bounce off each other with F LYO - TYS, F TYS - LYO if you're worried about me going to WES", "But if you have something else in mind I\"m happy to hear it", "I can\u2019t be doing that, I need to use it to support ION with turkey being dumb", "Let me think, how late will you be checking messages tonight", "Probably not much later to be honest", "Been sleeping too late recently", "I'm generally averse to just holding, but I can do that for this turn if you need to support F Ionian", "Can you just hold this turn instead of hitting it?", "Make amends for my ill-fated incursion", "Was about to ask, I\u2019ll fix it this coming year", "Thank you", "Thank you, small amounts of trust regained", "They are now twice as large as the next largest power", "We need to do something about Russia", "Yeah I know they\u2019re getting big", "Turkey should be on board for sure, and it seems like England dropped", "So need to get Germany on board", "Let them know that I promised to cooperate, and that you will back them up if I break my word on this", "I will aim to fight the Russians in England while relieving the pressure on Germany in the west", "Does this mean you are going to pull out of LYO?", "Depends if you are pulling out of TYS :P", "Like I said earlier, I'm perfectly content to just stay there, but would also be willing to discuss demilitirization", "How does me moving into Tun sound", "It would certain be the most parallel option to me moving to Spain", "Sounds like a deal to me", "Sounds good!", "Not a fan of your move to West Med", "I know I haven't really earned much trust from you, but we need to present a united front against Russia and Germany or else Russia will win", "No you haven\u2019t", "For what it's worth, I've kept our demilitirization since our discussion", "And Germany is likely to be the main beneficiary in the event of a French collapse", "Well, looks like this is it for me", "Given that I pissed away a winning position with an ill-advised stab on you, I doubt I'll be missed much", "But best of luck for the rest of the game!", "Nah we\u2019re going for a three way so that\u2019s it for all of us, good game though!"],

I was already building a fleet on the North Coast of St. Petersburg just for insurance against the Brits, but that can easily become an offensive. If you broke any possible support from the North Sea, I could walk into Norway in spring.", "Count me in!", "Alright, from there I can try to push them out of the North/Norwegian Seas and you can move into the Netherlands and beyond. Have you talked with the French? We don't necessarily need them, but for a proper Sealion their help would definitely be a good thing to have.", "Yeah agreed. My theory/fear is that they may be in negotiations with England. France was asking me to take denmark and holland and then all of the sudden changed course and supported my incursion into Belgium.", "That is awfully suspicious.", "Agreed.", "I'll probe them for information, let me see what I can get out of them; even if they were involved with that they'll probably play their cards pretty close to the chest though.", "Agreed.

What would you advise for me moving forward, particularly with my two incoming builds?", "Considering what we're up against, I'd build a fleet in Kiel and an army in Berlin, but you need to switch the army in Denmark for a fleet as soon as possible and get that down to the French border.", "If France and Britain are determined to, they can ensure that the fleet in Belgium is destroyed, unfortunately. But they can't do that while also holding both Norway and the Netherlands.", "The English and French both made some odd choices with their builds. I think the British anticipate me coming for them.", "Not great", "Either way, I think I'll be able to outmaneuver them long enough to force a disband.", "Have you spoken with the French recently? They haven't done anything overtly aggressive toward you so maybe you can still flip them; I've got reliable intelligence that apparently the English don't approve of that fleet build in Brest so we might be able to break that alliance up with a determined effort.", "That\u2019s wonderful news. We\u2019ve spoken a bit.

We need to be in sync with our moves to play the advantage. Let me know what you think would be good next steps for me.", "The near term goal in my mind is breaking england to persuade France to complete the sea lion", "I'm trying to sow distrust among them at the moment but I don't know if I'll have much luck with England. They're being very cagey. But anyways, the survival of your fleet in Belgium, at this point, depends on you either convincing the French not to block you out of either the English Channel or Piedmont, OR, using the fleet in Kiel to support an attack against the army in the Netherlands; the first isn't ideal because it's relying on the French, but the second isn't ideal because it's keeping Kiel stationary and thus blocking the exit of the Danish army, which is practically dead-weight where it is since it can't support to any of the sea-zones around it. \n\nI'd move Munich to Ruhr and Berlin to Munich. Additionally, I would do the second option with your fleets whether or not you get an agreement from the French.

I have as well, I'm doing everything I can to convince them that attacking the British is a great idea.", "Nice! Good call. Any other suggestions? I\u2019m pretty open to anything", "Italy says that France and England are allies", "They are, but I've been working to break it up. I've not got any suggestions for the time being other than what you have; you should be able to guarantee that you have Holland by the end of the year, though you may lose Belgium in the process.", "Cool as long as your on board with my current moveset plus the bounce into the North Sea", "I absolutely am. Hopefully the French either stay uncommitted to the attack or join our side.", "I ran those other moves by France, with the except of the North Sea move you suggested. Should I tell france to build trust, or would the potential of it getting back to england be risky", "I think that it's almost guaranteed that it would get back to the English. I wouldn't tell them much more about your plans at all, if you can help it.", "Sounds good! Let me know if you have any other thoughts, if not, my moves are submitted.", "If something crosses my mind I'll let you know ASAP.", "Great call with the North Sea", "What are you thinking for my next steps? I don\u2019t like france\u2019s moves.", "France is definitely coming for you, but how's this for a tricksy little solution to the issue: \n\nCurrently you are at serious risk of losing Belgium; that sucks, but if you move yourself to Holland you can avoid the destruction of that fleet. Even better though, if you make another move toward the North Sea, I can now *support* that move with Norway, meaning that unless the British successfully predict that, you are in position to take Edinburgh and threaten London unless they pull fleets back; if they pull fleets back, it takes pressure off of me and allows me to forward-deploy my own fleets, which are currently pinned down by British blockade.\n\nFurthermore, you can move your fleet from the Helgoland Bight into Holland to take it, and use Kiel to support Munich to ensure Munich holds for long enough that the British have to disband. There are risks involved in the maneuver of course. The British could not only move themselves to Belgium, but they could move their fleet from the North Sea into Holland, bouncing you out and keeping all of their forces intact despite the loss of the North Sea.", "Word I actually love that strategy.", "I\u2019m in. We need to think strategically about what information we deliver to England/France and how.", "So I'll be supporting from Belgium to the North Sea then? There's a further significant risk that the British will use one of their fleets in the north to defeat Norway's support and thus keep the North Sea AND Netherlands AND take Belgium.\n\nPersonally, I actually am not a fan of the move. Too many risks to be realistically successful this turn, better saved until next year I think. You're better off using the Helgoland Bight to support Belgium in a retreat to Holland for the time being, and then perform this maneuver next year when your position is more solid and the British have lost a unit. If Munich weren't under enough risk that you could use Kiel to support into Holland as well it would be much more viable.\n\nSorry to be doing all these thought problems in full view, I'm just trying to work out how best to break Britain and get ourselves on the offensive. This turn ain't it though I think.", "Doesn't help that the Austrians are actively betraying me.", "No no I trust your judgement. If we\u2019re going to win this fight against England, we need to be lock step.", "I couldn't agree more.", "No, it does not. I have minimal communication with them, we basically exchanged a half dozen messages keeping the neutral territories neutral.", "Just so you know in advance, given my newfound conflict with them, I may have to occupy Warsaw indefinitely.", "Thanks for bringing that up! Totally fine with me. I have bigger problems for the foreseeable future . Fighting with my one reliable ally is the last thing I want.", "Yeah, it's a real touch-and-go situation but I really think that reducing the British for the time being was good progress.", "Yeah for sure", "What full moveset would you recommend for me?", "A Kie S Mun\nA Mun H\nF Bel - Hol\nF HEL S Bel - Hol\nA Den H\n\nThis moveset still leaves some risk if they anticipate it unfortunately, but I doubt that they'd risk me being able to move to SKA for it. We can only hope though, your position is still extremely unstable.", "Where is that London army going? That\u2019s my question.", "France is telling me that I need to cede Belgium to him for any further cooperation. While I crave France coming on board for the sea lion, I don\u2019t trust anything he says.", "Well it tried to go to Norway, if the British anticipate me being conservatively defensive in Norway (Which is my current plan) then there's the possibility that they will attempt to convoy it to Holland with Ruhr's support. Which wouldn't succeed, but would bounce you enough that they'd keep it.\n\nEither way you can't stop the French from taking Belgium anyways, you might as well agree for the time being.", "Yeah that\u2019s fair.", "How are your conversations with France going?", "I've got a tricky plan to either reverse psychology them into putting us in an advantageous position, or find out if they're trustworthy. Standby.", "Dope", "Don't tell France anything even remotely specific for the time being, they might just be feigning this willingness to cooperate in order to get strategically useful information to plan their next attack to ideally counter whatever you tell them.", "Yeah that\u2019s a good read.", "By the way, I'm currently buttering them up with some nonsense about not giving a toss about you. If they come to you as if delivering that as a world shattering revelation, don't be fooled. I'm playing them.", "Okay!!!

I don't know if I trust that intelligence, but it would mean you could use Kiel to ensure entry into the Netherlands.", "The English are either far more gullible and temperamental than the English, or they're trying to play me.", "I think I might have them duped; they just said that they're going to come talk to you, please relay back what they told you. Maintain the original order set.

If we take Constantinople and Bulgaria simultaneously in Fall, we not only deprive them of an additional build, we also put ourselves in the position to destroy them in the next year completely.", "Hey, you cool? You're making a lot of aggressive moves here. I need you to chill out before you ruin the entire offensive. I told you well in advance of the end of the turn that I was tricking the Turks here and that we'd have you in Bulgaria by the end of this turn, why are you doing this?", "i didn't believe you.  if you really wanted to work with me there was no reason not to help me into bulgaria when i could have then leant my help in return.  all you had to do was move moscow into sevestapol and your fleet into black sea and we could have been golden.  when you told me you weren't going to help that said to me that this is a set up.  I am not sure where this leaves us but we could have been in a much stronger position", "Are you serious? Did you even read what I sent to you? I told you that we were going to take Constantinople and Bulgaria in one fell swoop in the fall, take the Turks completely by surprise and have them annihilated before the next build phase; if the army in Bulgaria was knocked back to Constantinople we'd have another two years of maneuvering to knock them out ahead of us. You ruined that.", "dude... look at the map/  that would not work.", "unless he was completely stupid there is no chance that could possibly have worked", "It literally did work! It would have worked like a charm if you hadn't messed it up! The Turks trust me implicitly! I could have landed in Constantinople and they'd have been taken entirely by surprise because they thought I was allied to them! I told you literally all of this", "so you were trusting him not to do that as well even with his army sittin right in Arm", "then at best you et the territory you wanted. i get nothing, and at worst he takes sevestopol from you because that is what he told me he was going to do", "no because if that was the case they wouldnt trust me and the would defend bulgaria", "sorry man ive played this too many times to know what was likely to happen in that situation", "His army in Armenia is a feint, play fighting because he didn't want you and Italy to think that we were on the same side, which I specifically told you was happening because I needed you to fucking trust me when, for one turn, I supported the Turks to stay put to keep the subterfuge up. I was going to build in Sevastopol to prevent them coming toward me once the act fell, you were going to be 2:1 going into Bulgaria because the Italians were going to cut its only possible support. You were going to get Bulgaria, I'd get Constantinople, and the next season would see us wipe them out the rest of the way.", "again.  if he is trusting you then he is not trusting me.  which means you take the territory and I dont", "Are you a fucking amateur? Greece+Serbia outnumbers Bulgaria, they can't get support from the Aegean because the Italians were going to cut that support, it was going to be a fucking walk-in victory with the added bonus of forcing that army to disband because I'd have parachuted into Constantinople.", "I have the Turks practically taking marching orders from me, this was going to be the perfect offensive until you decided to go off script.", "Whatever, it doesn't matter. We can get back on track; The Turks are going to go whole-hog on Greece, you'll have to support it to keep it. Remove yourself from Galicia away from my territory, regain my trust, and we'll restart from where we were Spring this year. If you don't, then you've got quite the situation on your hands. One that Austria never wins.", "the only way he can take greece is with your help", "which means why would i trust you and leave galicia", "there needs to be some sort of trade that might make things believeable between the 2 of us", "He's assuming that you're going to use all your support on attacking Rumania and that Italy's going to make another play for the Eastern Med, obviously. In fact, it's not even possible for me to anything more than tangentially involved, and that's assuming that you were going to use your support from Serbia toward Greece anyways. I'm just telling you what he told me, if you want to criticize his tactics talk to him. \n\nWhat's this trade you're proposing?", "Quite frankly, since you're the one doing the betraying and I have thusfar told you literally nothing but the truth and tried to help you, I feel absolutely no need to give you much, but I'm curious about your proposal anyways.", "No proposal then?", "I was not home for the night.", "Ah, I see.", "well i am going to watch the caps hockey game.  I will be back after to see what you have to say.. but any suggestion will have to go along with you trusting me to leave my army in gal.  in exchange you would have to help me somehow and if the trust holds then next year i could move out of gal.  anyhow. i will be back on probably around 10:30p", "out watching the caps vs bruins game with some friends", "anyhow.  my suggestion was going to be I stay in gal for a turn and you support me into bulgaria with rum.  that still allows you to also take one of turkeys territories if he still trusts you.  if that happens I move out of gal next turn renewing the safe border and then we finish off turkey", "we can still accomplish the same thing", "im honestly not sure how we trust each other right now. it would be a leap on both our parts.", "what are your thoughts?  I need to make moves and get some sleep!", "Ill check messages in the morning before I make moves.  I need to get some sleep.  until later", "No. I did nothing to break your trust. You move out of Galicia or I won't deal with you. We made an agreement, I told you in advance of all my plans and you raised only minimal objections, before deciding to make moves to betray me. \n\nI won't be coerced into allowing you to break our very first agreement just because you didn't think hard enough about what I told you to see how it would work.", "i wrote that since it didn't seem like you were responding.", "i will move out of galecia", "Alright, I'll support you into Bulgaria then.", "why didn't you take con?", "Because I didn't have the chance to change my orders and was in full panic mode about you betraying me when I wrote them.", "ah well.  i didn't get to edit my orders either", "i didnt realize he was going to adjusticate so quickly", "i was trying to adjust my orders after i saw your message", "ah well. i need to go to bed.  im too tired for this. good night", "Sleep well", "Hey, I can get the Italians to back off of Tyrolia if you disband the fleet in the Adriatic instead of the one in Albania.

If you have to deconstruct two units this turn you'd have a hard time stopping them too. That's just my personal take though.", "No, I'm worried about france too. Why do you care about how well I do?", "Lol france is asking for me to support into Munich AND belgium, leaving me at 3, them at 7, and liverpool exposed.", "I'd rather have more troops in the south. Things are getting weird. I also think that France is using you; every time I talk to them they're very lukewarm on the topic of you, furthermore, with them fighting the Germans and soon to be the Italians, they'd be an easy target if you moved fast enough. I think if you talked to the Germans they'd be more than willing to discuss.", "Also lmao that'd be a disgustingly arrogant deal for them to offer, I almost don't believe you.", "I stabbed germany with holland, they don't like/trust me. I do get the sense france is trying to use me.", "No, I'm serious. I tried explaining how stupid that was to them and they were like \"Munich is really importand for France, and from there I could support you into Kiel/Berlin.", "I think that if you earnestly offered, and proved your willingness to work with the Germans by pulling off of them for a season, that they'd be all too willing to pivot to the French, personally.", "That's a set up to build a fleet in Brest to pick you off solo, I can almost guarantee it.", "Or, it's just russia trying to persuade enland to attack France, who he doesn't want to see becoming to powerfull \ud83d\ude09", "Lol I'm allowed to have ulterior motives aren't I? I admit that that would be a good outcome, but just speaking honestly and frankly, you have no chance of stopping a French solo if all goes wrong for you this turn, how long will it take before they see you as liability that they can't afford? I'm just offering options aside from that, because tbh that's always a depressing outcome for the English.", "The Entente is a powerful alliance for France, but it's never more than a silver medal for the English.", "ok. Support me into Denmark this turn and we have a deal", "Ill attack them", "I want a season of you backing away from St. Petersburg first. Again, no offense, but if I say \"yes\" to that and you believe me, it's a golden opportunity to take Norway back for you, and I don't know that you'd pass it up.", "If you're being honest, your fleet has nothing to do in the Barents anyways", "I still want to do an agreement where I get norway and you get Denmark.", "Barents would move to Norway", "Alright, you have yourself a deal. If you're lying though, it's back to basics.", "I'd prefer we exchange those at a later date though.", "I... really need supply centers. Let me talk to france and germany, and I'll let you know in a bit what the plan is.", "If Barents is gone, Nwy isn't a threat. in fact, I am a bit worried that you won't hold your word, and even if you do, Nwy will be easy for you to get with Sweden and Stp", "If Barents is gone it's 3 v 3 and I wouldn't be able to get back in if I wanted to, you'd still have the North Sea and Norwegian Sea.", "Well, barring the Germans, but they're about to lose 2 supply centers so not much to fear there.", "No, i need fleet Nth for many things, and won't always support norway", "Well that just means you'll have to trust me as much as I'm having to trust you with this move, eh?", "Yeee", "Besides, part of you moving away from the Barents is that I want to be able to move that army goddamnit, lol", "huh?", "The army in St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg is perhaps the last place I want to have it.", "Right.... where *is* norway going?", "Army Stp can't move into the barents...", "Unless you invented submarines", "St. Petersburg of course. It's not got much else to go to. I'm proposing BAR as a sort of demilitarized zone; the reason I want the army out of St. Petersburg isn't so I can build there, it's so that it can go help in the south.", "Moscow, Warsaw, and Sevastapol are all further south than Stp...", "You are correct, and that's why I want the army to go down there to help out silly head. Not sure where the confusion stems from.", "\"the reason I want the army out of St. Petersburg isn't so I can build there\". Build in Stp = fleets to attack england", "OH SHOOT, you said \"isn't\" I thought you said \"is\"", "lmao", "Yeah lol, no worries, that shit happens to me all the time.", "Wait, so do you want to do the norway + denmark thing this turn?", "That is correct.", "k", "I'd prefer to have that buffer period where you move away, but you seem adamant on that.", "Well, I'm moving away at the same time. It's up to you if you leave Stp there for a turn or not.", "Where is Nwy going?", "Well yes, the big concern is whether or not you'll actually support me into Denmark; have your cake and eat it too sort of situation.", "this move does kinda require a lot of trust", "I suppose it'd go to Sweden first before heading off to St. Petersburg.", "Either that or swoop down to the Baltic", "Ok, I'm going to be 100% honest hear. Its a huge pain in my ass to support you into denmark this turn. I don't want to lose you as an ally. Can we do it next turn?", "Also I gtg pretty soon, but ill be back withing 1.5 hrs", "If we don't do denmark this turn, we don't have to do norway this turn, but I would really appreciate it as I need the centers, and also it would be getting out of the Baltic. I don't think I'm going to be able to get out of there otherwise, as I'm not sure my move from NWG to NTH will go through", "I don't know if I'm going to be losing a supply center in the south this turn, I can't afford to not gain one to compensate, you know how it is. Sorry but I really need Denmark if I'm losing Norway", "Alright, that's reasonable to me.", "Not doing the trade this turn I mean", "Then you not losing a center!", "It seems as if you are controlling turkey. They are a stupid player and you can steal a center with them.", "I know that's optimistic, but it's worth a try.", "\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "God if only you knew how complicated things are down there.

Talk to them. Get turkey to support you.", "If only it was that easy. The Austrians distrust me now. I'm going to be real with you, they're massive idiots. The Turks already support me but even with their support it's possible to lose either Rumania or Warsaw, depending on if I guess correctly.", "gah. Fine", "want to bounce somewhere so it doesn't look like were allies?", "with Bar", "You could easily bounce off of Stp or Norway and tell anyone suspicious that you thought you could easily get

It certainly is shaping up to be a pretty standard Lepanto right now.", "What's the plan for Spring? Do we spring the trap now?", "I think we probably should -- do we want to attack ser right away or just focus on holding what we have while we bring our other units into position?", "Attacking Serbia without support moving into Bulgaria risks leaving it empty with an enemy fleet in the Aegean if the Austrians attack with the fleet in Greece, and would likely just bounce if they tried to attack with the army in Serbia. Maybe wait a turn to get fleets into better positions?", "Alrighty, I'd be on board with that", "Would it be possible to get your support in holding onto Bul then, or do you think we should keep up our pretending? (if possible, id like to be able to move my fleet to aeg)", "I can do that yeah. Things would be easier and more fluid defensively if I moved into the Black Sea, but I get if that would be trusting me a little farther than you're willing to.", "I was just about to suggest that myself actually -- tho the support in Bul would still be appreciated for this turn", "Alright, just didn't want to overstep the lines, you know how it is. I can probably even use it to keep up the subterfuge even with supporting you, since it would be really easy to misclick supporting Bulgaria to stay put rather than supporting Serbia to Bulgaria.", "Do you think you'll move both fleets out or support one into the Aegean?", "I was thinking of moving both out but I'm not 100% decided yet", "Well a standard Lapanto requires that Italy move into Eastern Mediterranean, so at worst if the Austrians try to move into the Aegean you'd have both bounced. I can talk to both of them and ensure that the Austrians don't do that though, so you can bounce the Italians *and* succeed at moving into the Aegean.", "That would be the ideal, if you supported into the Aegean the Italians would succeed at moving into the Eastern Med and then you'd have problems.", "That's what I was hoping for yea -- though I'm also not really sure whats up with the Austrian fleet build", "Yeah, the Italians are on edge about that as well. The Austrians are opaque though since they only speak in a single 10 minute period on any given day.", "ain't that the truth rip lol", "Hey, I think I can get the Italians on our side against Austria, are you willing to let them have Greece?", "I'd be ok with it in the short term maybe, but if they get too big, itll be kinda hard for me to make any sorta progress in the med ya", "Yeah, obviously it's temporary, but in the short term having them on our side helps us speed Austria's demise significantly, and their position will be absurdly weak.", "Thanks for the backup in Rumania btw, didn't suspect that the Austrians would catch on before we'd gotten started. I'll likely need that support again I'm afraid.", "Alright, thats fair yea; and especially with France in the west, we should be ok to take out Italy after", "Yeah, so the usefulness of getting Italy Greece is significant since it gets them a build to use on Austria's second front, and puts more friendly units on our very own front line. I take it you and they have started speaking?", "Yep", "Good good, we'll have the Austrians on the ropes by the end of next year hopefully.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "BTW I'm feeding Austria a heaping helping of bullshit right now to try and get them to back up off of me so that I can be in better position to attack, just in case they try to snitch and show you the bullshit I'm telling them. I'm still playing them as if I'm their friend who wants to regain their trust and attack you.", "But yeah, just to be clear before nightfall, you're going to support an Italian convoy to Greece right? Just want to make sure that things don't go wrong for want of communication.", "Yea that's the plan", "Just to be clear, you're also supporting Bul right", "Of course, if Austria got squirrely and took Bulgaria it'd be a disaster for both of us.", "I could also have Rumania support an attack on Bulgaria to cut support if he sees an attack coming from there (And even possibly take it) if you like, but that has some risks attached I think.", "An attack on Serbia, sorry.", "Yea, Greece just retreats to bul then, and it gets messy for me", "Oh yeah they would, wouldn't they? I didn't even think of the retreat tbh. I'll support you to hold then.", "If you want to get fancy, we could both tap ser, and with tun hitting Greece, Bul would be safe -- that does put rum at risk tho so it's a bit dicey", "Yeah, I'd rather keep Rumania in place just in case the Austrians decide to throw all their force behind it.", "Alright, that's fair, just putting the option out there", "Yeah. So then, we've got Black Sea and Bulgaria supporting Rumania then? Possibly Ukraine if the Italians get Austria to tell them their plans and it turns out that they intends to throw all of their forces behind an attack there.", "Depending on what the Italians can tell us, we might also need Bla to support bul, (in case Bud taps rum), but pretty much that yea", "Of course, the intelligence we get defines our strategy. I just hope that the Austrians didn't go AFK for the rest of the night until the orders hit like they normally do.", "Speaking of going afk, I have to go take a final exam now, but I'm pretty sure my orders are set anyways ?", "Unless the Italians deliver something earth shattering, I think so yes. Good luck on your test!", "Thanks :p", "Are you alright if I build an army in Sevastopol?", "I'd rather see it in Moscow to be honest, but if you feel like it's necessary I won't object too much", "I just want to keep the Austrians guessing about what I intend to do with that. Plus, I already convinced them again that I'm on their side despite having supported you for two turns now, so it might be important to speed things up to keep up the pretense that I might think about going toward you. Keep them confused, y'know?", "Alright, that's fair, just as long as they're the one getting tricked :p", "Think the Italians and I are supporting you into Serbia first turn, and then me to Budapest the second, that scan as far as what you know?", "That sounds like what the Italians proposed to me yea", "Excellent, that'll leave the Austrians on the ropes, we can think about moving on the Italians after that depending on the situation", "Sorry for the deception -- I only decided at the last minute and I also didn't want any leaks getting to Italy", "I understand, but it's not like I'm gonna leak to them anyways", "As long as you'll help Galicia move into Budapest I don't mind", "Meaning that you'll poke Serbia to break any possible support of course.", "Alright, will do, thanks for understanding", "-- oof --", "Yeah, sorry.

{"messages": ["Greetings, Russia!\n\nWe don't have too much to discuss early on, but I was curious on whether or not you were planning to move A Moscow - St Petersburg, where you could make a play for Norway.\n\nAnd likewise, was curious whether you planned to order F Sevestapol - Black Sea, or else allow Turkey to occupy it.\n\nIt's early, but we might have room to cooperate against England or Germany in the future. Let's keep in touch. Good luck.", "I'd be very interested in organizing a group effort against Britain right now. I likely won't move to Saint Petersburg the first turn in case the Germans try something but I'm definitely bouncing in the Black sea.", "Understood, what's your plan then? \n\nYou might consider Moscow to Livonia, which would still improve your situation in the north (since you could convoy to Sweden and then build in StP), while also helping to cover Warsaw.\n\nOr else you could just commit both of your armies to the south.", "I've spoken with the Germans, and a group effort against the British is likely. I'm still considering various ways to secure my position better, but I think keeping one army put in Moscow offers the best stability for the time being; If the Germans are telling the truth it will likely move to secure a spot in Finland in the second year.", "I would advise against staying put. Both Ukraine and Livonia can defend 3/4 of your centers. St Petersburg  can't be attacked year 1 and the risk to Sevestapol is nominal in year 1, since even if he goes all out you bounce him out of Black Sea and he can only make an unsupported attempt from Armenia", "Going to Livonia is just as good for defending against Germany but gives you more options in the North", "Perhaps you're right, but an emergency is more likely to materialize in the south, in the rare case that Austria might deploy full strength against me, and the utility of remaining in Moscow in that case is much greater. I prefer the overall flexibility to the ability to deploy quickly to Scandinavia personally.", "If you are concerned about the worst case on defense, I would order A Warsaw - Galicia and A Moscow - Ukraine", "The absolute worst case is: \nA Berlin - Prussia or Silesia\nA Smyrna - Armenia\nF Ankara - Black Sea\nA Vienna - Galicia\nA Budapest S A Vienna - Galicia or - Rumania", "Even in that nightmare scenario, you can defend all your centers with A Ukraine S Sev H (if Austria went to Rumania) or support Warsaw (if they went to Galicia with support)", "I have to be careful not to provoke a worst case through concern for it. Remaining in Moscow on the first turn only marginally reduces my ability on the second turn in the north, while it retains the ability to support/ go south quickly if all goes wrong.", "I'm greatly tempted to take that army to Finland in any case.", "Have you talked to Italy? Even if you're not going for an Austrian offensive, they could provide a hedge against an Eastward move by Austria. You can also deny working together in the event that Austria is offended by this.", "The Italians have been relatively tight lipped, they haven't spoken much more than the Austrians and the Austrians haven't spoken at all, which is concerning to say the least.", "That's... Interesting. In my experience with Italy, Russia is the one country you can rely on, since they're a potential ally against either Austria or Turkey. It's strange that they haven't been recruiting your alliance", "I haven't heard from Austria either. They're the one player I haven't heard from", "Well that's reassuring at least. Are the Germans on board for a sea lion in your opinion? They haven't responded to my counter-proposal after they requested they get Norway. Hard to tell if they are unsatisfied or if they simply haven't had time to respond.", "My conversation with Germany was very brief. All I know is that they agreed to a bounce on Burgundy, which is kind of a no brainer for them if they believe that I am going to Burgundy. Which I am, and I told them so.", "Alright, they probably spoke to you in the same window of time that they did to me. Did you talk about which of you gets Belgium?", "We did not. Since I am expecting to get bounced in Burgundy and am not planning to enter the Channel in year 1, I will likely have no say in the Belgian question.", "I am happy to let England and Germany fight for it", "Well that reinforces my wish to disallow the Germans the use of Norway, if he's likely to get Belgium then he certainly doesn't need it.", "Indeed. Seems like a rather greedy fellow.", "If I was less concerned about the British I'd not consider them as highly for alliance, temporary or otherwise.", "Interesting sentiment! What makes you so so concerned about the British?", "I've seen too many Russias undone by British armies in St. Petersburg; their advantage in navy can easily push you out of Scandinavia and your only means to create fleets in the north. Of all Russia's existential threats, they're the worst one because they're Britain's easiest target.", "At the risk of harping on the same points, this is part of why I find it's important to maintain a strong presence in the north", "With an army in St Petersburg (ideally), and a fleet in Sweden, not only can you pretty comfortably keep the English out of St Petersburg, you have pretty good odds of evicting them from Norway", "You could even bounce them in Norway, where they would end up without a build", "I get that, I just don't see Livonia as having any particular utility that Moscow doesn't have aside from the ability to convoy to Sweden or Finland; but Sweden is a position better served by a fleet anyways. Finland though, is a place built for armies, but I could get there easier via St. Petersburg. I'd like to bounce the Brits in Norway but it's imperative to keep St. Petersburg free for the 1902 build so that I can get a fleet there.", "I do think that Livonia strengthens your position in the North, but it's more helpful if your target enemy is Germany than England. It allows you to convoy into Sweden in Fall 1901, build in St Petersburg, and then use A St Petersburg and A Sweden to pressure Norway while F Gulf of Bothnia goes to the Baltic", "If you commit three units to the south or stay in Moscow, you'll have at most one fleet and one army in the north. If you go to St Petersburg, you'll have that number at minimum, and if you convoy to Sweden you can realistically get to two fleets and an army", "I admit that the concept is warming on me. It also doesn't telegraph to the British that you don't trust them.", "St Petersburg is vaguely unfriendly, but one which England may not feel pressured to take action on, especially if they are under pressure elsewhere. However, they will most likely see a move to Livonia as an anti-German or a defensive move than one against them.", "True. Though the German perception of the move is a concern, as much as I don't relish them as allies, I especially don't need them as enemies.", "I personally think you can probably spin it as a defensive move, but I will acknowledge that it's hard to be sure when Germany has been so tight lipped", "Right, I just need more communication all around me honestly. I've only really come to a decisive conclusion with the Turks.", "Yeah, other than yourself, Turkey and Italy have been the only other powers who have been really talkative", "I've spoken to England and Germany enough to get the key points of alignments across, but not enough to build a relationship. Austria has been totally silent", "The Italians have only talked to me briefly and the Turks and I just about talked enough to agree to stay out of each other's way and to organize a bounce in the Black Sea.", "That's the same level as my discussion with Germany - to align to stay out of each other's way.", "Maybe it's a time zone issue. See if they talk overnight.", "Perhaps, I just hope the Austrians aren't dead-on-arrival", "I mean, if they are, you are likely to be one of the beneficiaries. I should be the one saying that!", "You're right, it's just a much less interesting situation if I just get to walk into Budapest and/or Vienna!", "Yeah, fair enough! Although it's only marginally worse than Austria just rolling over in the face of a Juggernaut alliance, as happens far too often.", "That's true; Austria really bums people out but tbh it's my favorite to play.", "The Germans are really stuck on Norway for some reason.", "Those cheeky sons of bitches the Germans had me so goddamn worried about getting bounced in Sweden and they didn't even go to Denmark turn one.", "Sorry for not responding sooner, I got a little drunk last night. But yeah, Austria isn't the strongest country, but playing Austria is kind of exciting in a way. Seems like in this game, both you and Germany are in good terms with them, so they'll probably be alright at least for now.", "Yeah, so long as they don't make any terrible mistakes", "Fixating on Norway and then not even going to Denmark is really strange. Not sure they can even get to Norway any time soon. Their move to HOlland instead is a little annoying for me and England, but shouldn't be the end of the world", "Yeah, I might just take Norway myself. Not any time soon mind, I need to get things relatively resolved in the south far before that.", "Yeah, it's hard for England to set up a strong defensive position in Norway, and if they were in such a position they'd probably push onwards to StP. So as long as you sort things out defensively you can probably evict England later.", "The English are getting rather unorthodox aren't they?", "To be fair, that's partly because they successfully anticipated an unorthodox move by Germany to vacate HOlland", "And you? I see you decided not to convoy to Sweden", "Army wouldn't do much good up there, still want to be able to pivot away if other issues arise. Better to potentially get the fleet out of the Baltic.", "If you convoy, you could get to the Baltic anyways, while having A Sweden which pressures both Denmark and Norway, as opposed to the passive A Livonia", "No I mean out of the Baltic, the whole body of water, to the Skagerrak (Potentially)", "Oh, that's more interesting", "You would definitely need to get through England to get anywhere in that direction. Does that mean you're thinking of building in StP nc?", "Indeed, it's all a future thing though, I've got no plans as yet for anything like that, gotta resolve the south a bit better first. And yeah, I'm definitely building a fleet in StP NC, can't afford the Brits deciding that I look like an easy target.", "Words to live by! And I assume the second build will be an army in Warsaw? Where do you stand regarding Turkey and Austria?", "Warsaw's neutral ground, as agreed with the Germans, so the second comes in Moscow.", "As far as Turkey and Austria goes, I'm inconclusive. Austria doesn't talk much but then again, neither does Turkey.", "I feel like if you build in Moscow and already have a unit standing by in Livonia, you could very easily end up being very passive.", "Also, I just noticed Turkey's move to Armenia", "Yeah, Turkey and I are having a nice talk about that, as much as can be, but they don't seem particularly determined to come after me considering they didn't touch the Black Sea. That definitely contributes to the south being \"Inconclusive\" as I said.", "They can though, at least if they're not afraid of the Austrians. They would just build a fleet in Ankara and support themsleves in", "That would be intensely concerning, but I very seriously doubt that Austria would be on board, and even if they are I don't feel as though the Italians would be interested.", "That's true. I guess if you feel comfortable with Austria and Italy, it's a reasonable position", "Right, barring a worst case scenario the situation in the south is stable at least.", "But not especially looking to go on the offensive?", "Oh I will be, just depends on which one ends up being more convincing in the next half-day.", "Odd choice to build the fleet in Brest.", "Without any fleets in the north I will be too vulnerable to a potential English stab", "Well we're of the same mind on that front at the very least. They certainly didn't appreciate when I did that though and I warned them in advance, did you at least clear it with them?", "I warned then in advance, but I'm not sure they saw it and they were unhappy either way", "However, I think Germany's moves have locked England and Germany into conflict, and I'm sure he'll forget about it after some success on the German front", "I wouldn't be so sure of that if I was you, the Italians tell me that the English are angrily blabbing about your plans to attack Italy with the forces you have in the south.", "There are no such plans... Time to do some damage control I guess", "Yeah, I figured it seemed fishy since if you planned to attack the Italians surely you'd have built another fleet in Marseilles.", "You know, I hate to sound like a broken clock, but you could be in Liverpool before the British could even do anything to stop you, if you started now and were sufficiently sneaky about it.", "I'll definitely take that under advisement. Of course, it would be a lot more tempting if a foreign fleet were in the Norwegian Sea or something", "I'm sure the British will be sufficiently distracted with trying to keep me from being tempted to take Norway and continuing the German campaign.", "Any pertinent information on the British plan that you know and/or are willing to give out by the way? Since they're being so imaginative with your plans and all.", "Nothing concrete, but they've indicated to me that they feel like they are on good terms with you, which might mean that they plan to prioritize defending Belgium over defending Norway", "Sorry, Holland", "Excellent, they'll definitely need to do that if they intend to keep that foothold and expand it.", "That does leave them vulnerable to an attack on Norway, however", "They're either vulnerable to one or vulnerable to the other, they can't have a guaranteed hold on both until Fall, and that's only assuming that their positioning relative to Germany doesn't worsen significantly.", "Yeah, and the other complication is that they can only go to Norwegian Sea to shore up their position .", "Indeed, if they move to the Helgoland Bight or Skagerrak to try and make room for more fleets to use against Germany they risk losing Netherlands and the foothold that they had established, with no more means of gaining ground against the Germans. If they had built in London they could move to the Channel to try and strongarm Belgium, but they built an army there instead.", "Of course if they felt comfortable with you, F Norway could go to Skagerrak to shore things up", "If they felt comfortable I doubt they'd have bothered to build a fleet that can go directly to the Norwegian Sea rather than one that can almost immediately deploy to harass and/or support Belgium.", "To be honest I\"m not sure I get the A London build at all. Liverpool is better placed for convoying since you could go to Clyde if you wanted to convoy through the North Sea", "I understand and appreciate that, if he intended to respect our demilitarization of the English Channel and expected me to do the same, F Edinburgh is better than F London", "But why A London then?", "Yeah, it's not a terribly competent build order all things considered. The fact that in one turn Liverpool can move to be convoyed through any sea zone around Britain means that it's significantly better for that, London only makes sense as a sedentary defensive move.", "I'm not sure it makes sense even as a defensive move. IN the event that I stab and go to the channel, they would likely be reluctant to use A London to bounce the convoy in Wales", "While it can obviously cover London itself, in that sense it is little better than Liverpool -> Yorkshire", "That's very true. Even in the context of pure defense it doesn't make a great deal of sense, especially given the likelihood of an attack originating around Liverpool and Wales.", "I suspect the thought process was more on the lines of initially wanting to build a fleet in London, deciding I would likely see that as an act of aggression, and changing it to an army", "Perhaps? Seems like an error of not enough foresight if that's the case.", "It still scans as a move to try and counter your influence or serve as a jumping off point for a surprise attack.", "Even for a surprise attack, F Nth - Eng, A Liverpool - York would make more sense", "Yeah, I'm not sure what they're doing, or if they even know what they're doing.", "Well, I feel pretty vindicated in taking Norway.", "Indeed. You should be able to hold both it and StP without much trouble now. Very aggressive attack by England", "Just wish the Austrians hadn't decided to ruin literally everything.", "Look on the bright side. Turkey seems firmly in your camp now. With their help Austria should be easy to manage", "Not without losses unfortunately. You know it might be more easy for me to put a fleet in the Norwegian sea if you didn't put so much pressure on the Germans.", "What assistance would you need from Germany? A Denmark is probably at your disposal - it can do nothing useful in the west. I've discussed with Germany a deal in which they take the North Sea but yield Belgium to me. They seemed receptive but it might just be saving face - you should approach them with a similar offer.", "You can no more help them take the North Sea than they can prevent you from taking Belgium, I think that the deal needs to be a bit better than that.", "And I mostly just need Germany's fleets to be free and clear to operate without possibly being harassed by French troops, because with German fleets I can free myself from Scandinavia, free an army for use in the south, and just over-all better my position on the board. It'd be pretty nice.", "I think the point is less that I would help them take the North Sea, and more that they should accept the loss of Belgium as a fait accompli and focus on the north sea", "Less a real alliance and more being a thought partner - I'm happy to talk to anyone, after all", "Here's a proposal for you: We'll all trick the British together yes? You have their trust, you can convince them that because I'm going to use all my resources to clamp down Norway, meaning that they cannot possibly take it, and that since the Germans are obviously going to support Munich with the army in Kiel that they cannot take it. Furthermore, \"you got the Germans to admit\" That they will only be coming to Netherlands with the fleet in Belgium + the fleet in the Helgoland Bight.\n\nThus you suggest that they do a supported move to the Netherlands using F North Sea and A Ruhr to block that, while you take Belgium.\n\nThis will fool them sufficiently that the Germans can use the army in Kiel to support the fleet in Belgium into the Netherlands as well as the fleet in the Bight, ceding Belgium to you in the process, while also freeing me of one necessary support so that I can move from Sweden to Skagerrak, and the British lose two of their units this build phase. Questions?", "In this scenario, you could propose something on the lines of:\nA Kiel S F Belgium - Holland\nA StP S F Sweden - Norway\nF HEL S F Norway - Nth", "This would secure Norway and Holland while also having good odds of catching England by surprise and seizing the North Sea", "That would bounce in Netherlands if they decided to use the North sea to move, but I'm assuming that you would be convincing them to do the opposite?", "Well, that depends on what's in it for me. I'm happy to talk, but if you want concrete action there's a few more points that need to be ironed out.", "Firstly, I already have Belgium in the bag, and similarly you have secured Norway. Further action rests on the premise that we would like to help Germany at England's expense. I've yet to be convinced of this", "If you secure the north sea while controlling Scandinavia, you are likely to capture the lion's share of England's centers, after all.", "You misunderstand me, I want to crush the British for our mutual gain/security. Helping the Germans has nothing to do with it materially, it's about eliminating a mutually existential threat.", "All I'd realistically ever want is Edinburgh", "If you send even one fleet to harass the English I could break out of their cordon and we could split them in two, once they're dead I don't give a toss about the Germans, you can do with them what you will.", "I think it would better serve my interests to crack Germany first, and then help you fight England. You and Germany actually have reasonably robust defensive positions against England, after all", "If you like you could accelerate that process by occupying the Baltic", "I can't occupy the Baltic until the English are gone. Full stop. I have had no opportunity to attack the Germans at all with the English riding my ass like they are, and won't for the foreseeable future if they keep those fleets hovering around me. I think it'd be far better for both of our peace of minds if we went for the one directly between us last.", "That's reasonable, I suppose. I think at this point my inclination is to seize Belgium and see how things play out from there", "I don't feel like I'm at risk of being attacked by a English-German alliance, which also means I'm not under a lot of pressure to commit to a side now", "Well hopefully the British lose Netherlands, destroying two of their units would be nice; Hopefully that'd help convince you to take the side with the upper hand as well.", "At least until the Germans lose their utility.", "Okay, my attack on England went nowhere, probably time to pivot", "You sure you didn't mean Italy?", "I actually meant Germany, but my attack on Italy didn't go anywhere either", "Probably pivot and attack England like you and Germany wanted", "That'd be pretty cool of you.", "I think in practice, that means F Picardy - ENG, and A Burgundy - Picardy", "It would be really helpful if you and Germany could evict England from the north sea as possible, which should be possible with\nF Nwy & F Hol S F HEL - NTH\nA Kie S F Hol H", "I'll relay to the Germans", "It's kind of a bummer that the English went idle.", "Indeed....

{"messages": ["Hey France \ud83d\ude01. I would like to suggest an alliance between the two of us, against Germany. In my opinion a England-France alliance is super powerful, especially if we can trust each other. Germany has reached out to me about an alliance to attack you, but franly I think France as a country is a much more powerful ally.To start I suggest we have the English Channel as a DMZ and coordinate and attack on Germany. Anyways good luck and have fun!", "Dear England,\nI completely agree that the French-English alliance can be quite powerful. Naturally, the main sticking point early on is whether we can trust each other to demilitarize the Channel.\nOn my end, I have little reason to go there unless I distrust you. I plan to go to Mid-Atlantic, which would allow me to move to Spain (south coast) and establish an early presence in the Mediterranean. Will also aim to get into Burgundy, where I can potentially support you into Belgium.\nMy suggestion is that you open with:\nF Edinburgh - Norwegian Sea\nF London - North Sea \nA Liverpool - Yorkshire\nThis guarrenteed you a build in Norway even if Russia moves A Moscow north, while potentially letting you convoy into Belgium. And you can be safe in the knowledge that either A Yorkshire or F North Sea can cover London in the event that I don't keep my word.\nLet me know your thoughts. Good luck to you as well!", "Sounds good!", "How are your relations with Germany?", "Getting into burgundy would be great. I\u2019ll work some magic with Germany and try to get them to not move there.", "Relations with Germany are not outright hostile, but it's a little tense.  Bounce in Burgundy is about what could be expected. \nSince they moved to Holland in Spring, you'll need to talk to them regarding the Belgium question. But they can probably be brought around. I'll move to Burgundy again, but probably expecting another bounce", "So... the thing is, their going to have to choose between Belgium and Denmark. If I let germany have Belgium, I could get Denmark, and have full control of scandinavia by 1902, from where I could launch a full-fledged russia attack", "I'm surprised Germany is on board with this", "It means allowing you to border Kiel. But if they're sincere, and not just offering it because it would be easier for them to capture Denmark next year than Belgium", "Then it could set you up well. I assume you are convoying into Denmark then?", "Well... germany isn't on board with this... yet. I messaged them but they havn't responded yet", "Well, it certainly strengthens our alliance a lot if you are able to occupy Denmark. We would be far better placed to partition Germany, and it would be easier to check Russian expansion", "So if you're comfortable with it, I suggest we just go ahead. Even if Germany causes problems, the two of us should be able to handle them.", "Well... if Germany moves into Denmark, it sucks for me.", "The last I spoke to Germany, they seemed interested in Belgium, but I'm not sure they had fully thought through the fact that taking Belgium would mean giving up on either Denmark or Holland", "It's obviously not ideal, but a bounce in Denmark would still be manageable - you still get one build in Norway, and Germany would also be limited to one build in that scenario", "I\u2019ll wait and see what Germany messages me back", "Deadline is coming up. Suggest you submit draft orders and revise them if/when Germany gets back", "Germany just said their not willing to give up on denmakr", "Oh... Have they offered you Belgium in exchange?", "I don't think it's going to happen. I'm not going to move to denmark.", "Also germany said you reached out to them about turning on me?", "I'm not sure if Germany is flat out lying, or if they're misunderstanding what I told them", "I told them that I'd be willing to let them have Belgium, which they then (unprompted) took to mean I was offering them Belgian in exchange for an alliance against you. However, what I meant was that it was just acknowledging facts. I couldn't stop them from taking Belgium even if I wanted to.", "I think it's already pretty clear that I trust you more than I trust Germany, just from the fact that I agreed to demilitarize the English Channel while we had an arranged bounce in Burgundy", "Ok... I believe you. Also, I don't think germany is the most seasoned diplomacy player... he told me he wanted to have an alliance with me, but that I HAD to give him belgium, holland, and denmark in return", "Yeah, Germany seems like a rather greedy player", "Didn\u2019t get into Denmark, but Holland is very nice as well", "Indeed, congrats!", "What's your plans for build? I was thinking of building A Marseilles to support myself into Burgundy and advance against Germany", "And then couple that with F Brest, which could go to Picardy to contest Belgium", "Also you can probably guess just based on your current situation, but Germany as approached me about an alliance against you", "Right. Hopefully you stick with the more competent player \ud83d\ude09", "Honestly, I figured I should do my due diligence and consider it, but I can't figure out how a France-German alliance would even work in this situation. It's not as if he could support me into Belgium", "U could tell him yes and then use that to stab", "I might do that, but he's in a tight defensive enough position as is", "Which is why you would do that...", "Im thinking a build in london and a fleet in edinburg", "As in, army in London and fleet in Edinburgh?", "yea", "Makes sense!", "Frankly, I don't like your fleet in Bre. An army could have contested Belgium as well.", "If you move it to the english channel... I'm going to take that as on obvious sign of aggression, and cover London. If you move it to picardy, were all good.", "Lol both russia and Italy reached out to me asking if you had accidentally switched those builds... I agree with them, they do seem pretty strange", "Strange or not, I'm fairly sure I told you earlier that I was thinking of building a fleet and Brest and didn't get any objections", "But at any rate, I can promise you that it will be going to Picardy rather than to the Channel. If it does go to the Channel, you should see that as an act of aggression on my part", "So, I've heard that you told Italy I'm planning to attack them with the fleet in Spain?", "Never said that...", "Interesting. Well, anyways that's not important. I'd like to apologise again for building the fleet in Brest without proper consultation - I assumed that you saw the message and were okay with it", "I will move to Picardy and continue our demilitarization of the English Channel. Hopefully we can put this behind us and focus on Germany", "Nice", "I should also be able to get into Burgundy, which would strengthen our position facing Belgiim", "Good.", "Where do you stand regarding Russia by the way?", "I\u2019m good with them, just trying to talk to other countries to try to keep a balance of power over there in the south. Turkey is basically free centers, and Russia is looking a little worrying.", "Turkey's move to Armenia should be a bit reassuring to you, since it puts pressure on Russia not to focus too much in the north", "But it's a little... Half-hearted?", "Yes. Like the first turn...", "One other thing to check - would you be comfortable with me sending F Spain to Mid Atlantic in order to get A Portugal out?", "Plan is to return to Spain afterwards", "Go ahead, but i personally think you should attack italy.", "Attacking Germany is the priority in my mind, especially since A Marseilles is needed on that front", "Can consider how best to attack Italy if/when Germany is dealt with", "On that note - we now have a very messy map. Let me put some thoughts on how to proceed", "Okay, retaking Norway is probably a lost cause, given that Russia tends to be a conservative player, and such a player will probably be very tempted to just do: \nF Sweden & A StP S F Nwy H", "I will do A Burgundy S F PIcardy - Belgium, which will cut support", "F Nth S A Ruhr - Holland should then be able to hold Holland", "Germany will then have a disband, , probably in Kiel, letting you rotate around into Ska and take Denmark", "Ok, I'm here now", "It's late at night for me, so I might not stay up too long, but what do you think of the suggestion?", "I seriously doubt I can get Norway back. My moves last turn were... well... risky. I asked if there was anything I could do for them to get Norway back, but I seriously doubt it. Belgium is guaranteed for you. The thing is, I'm not sure I can get Holland. Germany probably anticipates you taking Belgium, and will move into Holland with Belgium, and with support, their going to get it.", "Which means I'm at 3 centers, and won't have a chance of getting denmark.", "Thinking out loud here - if we assume Germany will anticipate that I attack Belgium and order A Kiel & F HEL S F Bel - Hol", "Munich would be vulnerable", "Would you be comfortable with F NTH S F Pic - Bel, A Ruh S A Bur - Mun? \n\nFrom there, I can support you into Kiel and/or Holland", "I'm hearing you ask me to support you twice this turn. If I do this I will almost undoubtedly lose two centers. I will be at 3. You will be at 7.", "it's simply not fair. I support you into Belgium, you support me into Munich", "It's always worth asking.

It's just that England is poised to take Bre and so I imagine France will be more interested in supporting Bre than they are with disrupting you. As such, I don't see it as much of a risk, if you were to support me into Mar", "I'll support you into Mar, but I want Spain and Portugal if that's alright?", "Deal. Can you get a fleet over there?", "Not this turn, but will do next year after taking out Turkey", "Perfect. Good luck wrapping up with Turkey.", "Thanks for the support. I didn\u2019t anticipate France supporting Mar.", "If England turns on me after France, I\u2019d appreciate it if you and I could work together. You could end up with Mar, Spa, and Por.", "That sounds good to me, we should be able to take him down together should it come to it", "France is threatening to give all of his centres to England if I don't 'back off immediately'", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m suspecting is about to happen to me too. Just asked France for an explanation. I wonder if it\u2019s a ploy by France to game us against each other.", "I\u2019ve offered France the opportunity to rebuild and work against England in case they reach out to you.", "I\u2019d like to get England around Spain and closer to going after you next so their out of position.", "Okay, sounds good. Will be interesting to hear their response", "I\u2019m open to other ideas if you have them. But if they surrender to England I think we\u2019re done for.", "I completely agree there, we can't have England taking all of their CPs", "Good. And it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ll be able to pick any centers up from Turkey unless Austria or Russia is working with you. Can you start moving you fleets back into the West Med? They could come in handy very soon.", "Aye, they'll both be heading back asap", "France is out. They\u2019re going to hand their centers over to England and think they\u2019re going to be left with one.", "I don\u2019t think we can take out England if this happens. Want to ensure we wipe France off the board first?", "Damn.\n\nYeah, can do. Hopefully if we can secure a few points we'll stand a chance of fighting off england", "Agreed but I don\u2019t think this is the turn to do it anymore. Thoughts?", "Not sure what you mean there", "Oh sorry. The turn to make the stab on England.", "Ah, right. Yes, I agree", "Nice job getting Mar. Are you planning on pushing toward Spain?", "Been talking to France to see if he can help to push England out of the med\n\nHave you had any contact with England?", "A little, just talking about my front with Russia. I mean you could take WES. And then you\u2019d have access to Spain and Portugal.", "Am planning on taking it this turn\n\nAm mainly using France as a diversion for England", "Thanks. Please let me know if you find out that France wants to move toward any of my centers.", "I will do.\n\nI'm only using him as a means to an end so hopefully he shouldn't pose that sort of threat for much longer\n\nWho are you planning on going after next, may I ask?", "Taking back Mun first hopefully. And then need to see where loyalties lie between Russia and Austria.

{"messages": ["Greetings!\n\nI was just wondering what your aims were regarding territory in the area? May I suggest that we keep Tyr as a DMZ for the time being?", "Hi there, Italy!  In my experience, Austria and Italy fighting anytime before 1904 or so ends one way: they are both eliminated.  So keeping a DMZ is good (ideally find a way to keep all four of TRL, ADR, TRI and VEN as a DMZ) but even better would be a joint goal we can work together on.  Typically as Austria my thoughts are to keep Russia and Turkey from allying, and pick one side against the other.  If you wanted to go after Turkey with me, that could work, but if you wanted to go after France (with either English or German help), I could go after Russia with Turkish help.  In general, I guess I\u2019m saying I\u2019m willing to go almost any sensible way that goes along with an alliance which I can grow to trust \ud83d\ude42", "I was definitely thinking of going after France, as I find they can quickly spiral out of control if uncontested.\n\nMight be best if you go after Turkey with Russia and I'll focus my attention West", "Awesome.  I reached out to Russia and will let you know how that turns out. You have any indications that you\u2019ll get any help against France? It can be a slow and annoying slog if you go 1:1 against them...", "England seems to be interested, so hopefully we can nip France in the bud ASAP", "So how did we want to move in Spring to set us both up to feel safe and not tightly entangled in each other\u2019s business?  Any particular moves you have in mind, given what you\u2019ve been hearing?", "Do you want to move against Turkey quickly? If so, I can suggest a strategy for us to take him out", "I\u2019d be happy to go after Turkey - once they control Aeg + Bla, they are nearly impossible to ferret out of that corner.  But if you\u2019re going after France with English help, nothing I do (even with Russian help) will go *fast* against Turkey unless the Turk just totally doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019ll go down, just not super fast - that\u2019s just how it goes against the corner pocket powers...", "This article has an effective strategy for neutralising Turkey but we'd need to work very closely together. What do you think?\n\nhttp://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/lepanto.htm", "The Lepanto works well against Turkey, but does require our combined full attention: it would mean you decide to drop your idea of going after France, because you\u2019d need both your first fleet and the one you build in Winter to be used in the east.  If you\u2019re interested in going easy with me instead of taking on France, then sure: I\u2019ll go to Alb in spring, and Gre in fall which sets us up for a supported attack on Aeg in spring 02.", "I appreciate your being true to your word and leaving Trl open. I trusted you and moved away from our mutual border.  I expect that France will run away from Pie now that they\u2019re under attack, but if you want to follow Ven-Pie, we would be in an easy position to have both Ven, Trl, Adr, and Tri all open as a safe DMZ, and could agree not to build in Tri or Ven without prior agreement.  Let\u2019s us work as safely together as any alliance could be while we go after Turkey without leaving many units home \u201cwasted\u201d just guarding against each other.", "Of course, if I end up bouncing in Gal again I may have to build another army in Tri, so if you want to leave Ven where it is and watch what France does for now, that\u2019s cool too!", "Those terms sounds most agreeable. I think it's definitely in our interest to work closely together", "For this turn, I will stay in Venice just to see if France pulls back. Just letting you know for full disclosure", "I totally understand. I appreciate the transparency: Adr + Trl still DMZ, but I understand your needing to wait in Ven to see what France does.  Do you feel you'll have to take Tunis with the fleet, or can we still do the Lepanto?  Taking it with F Ion-Tun slows us down by a full turn in our eastward movements, but if that's what needs to happen, so be it!", "I'm going to convoy into Tunis so as not to move the fleet", "excellent, that'll set us up for a convoy to either Syria as a sneak attack, or right into Constantinople if I can get into Bulgaria to support it, depending on which way the Turk tries to defend.", "Ideal. Reckon we'll have him out soon enough", "Oh just for full disclosure on my part: I may drop Vie-Ven to cover that, since it\u2019s a fall turn, and well \u201ctrust but verify\u201d is always sensible, right? \ud83d\ude42", "I totally understand, go for it", "I'll build in Vie and Bud, and leave Trieste open to help enforce our DMZ.  It looks like France won't be able to build any fleets, so I guess we'll see how long they can keep England and Germany from eating them up, eh?  You may want to consider using your \"rearguard army\" in Venice in France: either you can offer to help kill France (in exchange for a supply center: Mar) or prop them up (to slow down the EG alliance from progressing too fast), by using A Pie S Mar, which France will need once there's a german army in Gas.  Just some thoughts.", "I'm setting up the Convoy this turn. Are you able to shift south-east to assist in attacking Turkey?", "Yep - I'm taking Bul (with Russian help) this next turn, and in the fall, can both tap Con to cut any supports it may give, as well as move Gre-Aeg to help support your attacks on Smy.  Does that work for you?", "Sounds good. I'm helping to take down France as well", "cool.  Be tough about it: if they ask for your help, since you can't easily go over there with strength (until you've completed the convoy), demand they get  you into Mar as the first step, and from there you'll support the rest of their attacks.  If they say no, you can always say, \"if I'm not getting anything out of it, I may as well *support France*, instead of supporting their demise, you know?\" \ud83d\ude42", "Actually now that I look at the board more closely- since Turkey built an army, they are basically permanently no threat. If you want to change direction and focus your attention to focus on France, I wouldn\u2019t see it as a betrayal - my advance on Turkey would go slower, but it would still work, as two fleets aren\u2019t necessary to force advancement into Aeg. Either way: if you want to keep going east, I\u2019ll help you into Smy if you\u2019ll help me into Con after!", "I think we'll do the Smy and Con, I need me some supply centres", "sounds like a plan!", "As you imagine, I\u2019m heading to Aeg now, to help speed up the dismantling of the Turkey carcass :). What\u2019s up in France?  Germany going to let you have Mar, or are you going to slow down their advance so we can resolve the east before they get done in the west?", "He wants me to support him into Mar as he's worried they'll cut his supplies from Paris", "Makes sense - Germany has some guessing games in there...", "I\u2019d normally build A Vie, but England has 4 fleets ready to pour around Gibraltar into the Med (they\u2019ll say it\u2019s to kill France, but what do they do after taking Spain an Portugal?) and even after we get you this build from Smy, we\u2019ll only have 4 combined between the two of us.  If you want me to build a fleet I can, but if I don\u2019t hear from you I\u2019ll assume A Vie.", "You can build the army if you want, hopefully, we'll be able to take enough ground to build up our Navy soon enough", "I\u2019m fine either way, just trying to pick which way covers the most options. Vie protects from Germany, but they\u2019re still busy and Russia can help hold them off too.  A fleet makes sure England is matched but like you\u2019re saying, we can hopefully do that next year too.", "Germany has just told me that he's offered France protection if he goes against England", "oh wow, that would be very helpful!  I'll talk to him to encourage that.  England could be a huge threat with all those fleets if nobody goes against them.", "I'm going to bring my fleets back over as you've got Turkey pretty much sorted now with Russia", "Makes sense.  You going to try and help France and Germany against England?  Or attack France while Germany protects them?  Or just cover to make sure England does't swing too fast into the Med?", "Mainly cover against Eng", "Yeah good plan.  4 fleets right there is a lot.", "France is dipping out and giving his points to England. Hopefully Germany and I can take a few and maybe stand a chance of taking the fight to England", "makes sense!  it'll be a race to get there in time.", "It looks like Germany and England are coming east already.  I'm set up to push into Munich, once you can get around to Marseille and Burgundy.  I think I need to build a Fleet this year, because we otherwise don't have enough fleets to hold England back, even if Russia and I can make headway on the land.  Or are you trying to help France survive now?  Should I negotiate with them to offer support of Bur-Mun?  I think we need to get you a build from Marseille sooner rather than later, right?", "I've negotiated with France so that for now, he's going to let me into Mar if I support him into Spain for now\n\nIf he can help us kick Britain out of the med then I'm willing to do that for him now\n\nYou should probably ask him about Bur-Mun, as I reckon he'll want the help", "Oh I just realized Germany is getting a build, so it will probably be an army in Kiel, which will keep me from being able to get Bur-Mun to succeed.  But as long as I keep attacking Mun with support, it'll keep the German with all three units locked in place for now, which will hopefully help you in France.", "Fantastic", "We are going to need one of my fleets to move into Ion, because you don't want to have to waste F Tys S Tun against two english fleets forever.  Have they talked to you at all?  Seems like their actions speak louder than words...", "I must say that, as much I don't want to think it, you do seem to be converging to make a move against me", "If I wanted to attack you, I could indeed peel you apart right now, and there's not much you could do about it.  If I totally stay away from you, England pushes you right back to the borders of your homeland, and probably overcomes your defenses, given the location of the units right now.  Where would I be if that happened?  Do you think you have some tactics which would hold them off without any help from me?  If you have a plan that looks solid, I'm all ears.  I built the fleet, as I mentioned, specifically because England otherwise had us outgunned at sea, and clearly wasn't planning on fighting Germany.", "That's what I wanted to hear, I believe you.\n\nYou can move that fleet into the Ioanian, of course.\n\nMy only communication with England so far has been them trying to bargain with me to let them move on to take you out. So far I have not responded but, should we see an opportunity, I could always see how far a lie could get me", "I doubt England will believe either of us... \ud83d\ude26", "Probably not, but could be worth a shot at some point", "True.  Maybe try and see what they want?", "See, I told you that you could trust me.  Nice defensive work, btw!  England can't hold Tunis long, once you pull a fleet out into Tys, we can take it back.", "My army in Pie will be supporting Mar!  Unless we're using Mar-Bur to cut the support Bur can give to Mun, in which case Pie can support Gol-Mar as a beleagured garrison to make sure you hold onto it.", "I think I'll be holding in Mar this turn, want to shore up the med before attempting to move on again", "If you're holding, you can count on Pie to support it to hold, so you can focus your fleets on naval manouevers.  Speaking of which, we should talk tactics to keep the strongest position.  And you're building a fleet, right?", "Aye, I think a fleet would be the most useful for fighting England.", "GoL s Wes, Wes S Ion-Tun, Rom-Tys, Pie S Mar, Mar S Spa, and we ask France to do Spa S Wes?  Most likely, England orders NAf S Tun so as not to lose that, but then we hold position while Rom-Tys tightens the noose.  If on the other hand they give up on Tunis in Spring, by doing NAf and MAO s Tun-Wes, it does explode your fleet, but then we have Tys and Tun and you can rebuild the fleet and I can also build one if needed.  What do you think?", "That sounds agreeable to me. Just as a note though, will I be getting Tun back at some point in your plan?", "I most likely won't get in - if I were England, I'd use NAf to support Tun this season.  In which case Tys and Ion can work together to attack it next season.  But if I do get in, we get you that one back or Spain (if we can get France into Portugal at some point), whichever is easiest to juggle around.  If you ended up with *both* Spain and got Tunis back, am I just using three of my units out of the goodness of my heart?  ;P  - but seriously, priority one is push England out of the Med, priority two is to crack the E/G defense line, and beyond that, we just make sure to divide spoils fairly, and in a defensible way (no point in me owning Portugal, as how could I defend that?)", "That's fair, we should have this if we play our cards right", "Yep, there are some guessing games, but I think we have the better position now.", "So, we can get you Tunis this season, guaranteed: Wes-NAf, Ion S Tys-Tun, Tys-Tun.

In the meantime, you and England should definitely make sure to keep them contained in the north.", "Speaking of England, one thing annoying about E/G alliances is that you really only have this one chance to build a fleet without signalling your change of intentions too obviously: now.  Right now, a Fleet Berlin build does not scare/worry your English ally, because it's clearly meant to pin down scandanavia (F Den S Ber-Bal, next season, F Bal S Den-Swe, and you work with England to support them into StP).  Any build of a fleet later is clearly meant to attack England, and they see it coming.  It's almost as obvious a telegraphed signal as Austria building a fleet (I could *tell* Italy that I'll use it against Turkey, but they'd have to be pretty dumb to believe that!)", "Yeah good points. I\u2019ll see what I can do.", "For what it's worth: if you and England go after Swe + Stp, I don't really see Russia trying to retaliate on land: that stretches them super wide and thin, with some armies in the south fighting Turkey, and some against you, and a big gaping hole in the middle... where I sit with a pile of armies.  So if they're sensible, they'll just grumble loudly and ignore the loss in the north, biding their time to strike back once Turkey's subdued and they hope they can trust me to join them against you.  It's all in the timing, though!  I'd certainly not prefer it, but you could play nice with them, hoping you can work with them against *me* in the mid-game.  But I'm going to hope you don't go that way, because doing that just leaves your back wide open to English perfidy. \ud83d\ude42", "That\u2019s exactly why I brought up Russia. In a few more rounds I see them being just as thin but you me and England being stronger and with less weak spots near them.", "Yep, I'm right there with you. Let's keep watch, and if my working with them means that they end up getting a build from Turkey (likely, esp. if Turkey keeps messing up like this past season), I'll let you know in advance so that perhaps that's a time when you and England can make sure the lose one in the north at the same time to stay \"thin enough\" \ud83d\ude42", "How\u2019s it going?  Is Italy helping France survive, helping you kill them faster, or begging for a piece of the pie?  Looks like you\u2019ve got Russia pretty well pinned down in the north, too!", "Going pretty good. Looks like it for you too. I think Italy is coming in to get their piece of France before it\u2019s all gone. We\u2019ll see how it gets divided. Yeah especially with England\u2019s fleets up north.", "You and Russia have got Turkey finished off in a matter of a few turns it looks like. Any idea of where you\u2019re going next?", "I\u2019d be game for doing some damage to Russia with you, or if you decide to it\u2019s time to go after England with some minor Russian help, I could go the other way and take on Italy.  I\u2019m flexible \ud83d\ude42  My only preference is coordination: me going after Russia while you going after England leaves us both in 1:1 situations, inefficient.  So I like it when directions change in close order, when possible.", "I\u2019d prefer we go after Russia next. I would like to get a few more fleet builds and create an opening to position myself better against England before making that move. And this way we can remain coordinated.", "Understood.  Hopefully we can make that well coordinated (I\u2019ll have to know I\u2019m safe to turn my back on Italy).  I doubt you\u2019ll get a chance to build another fleet without signaling a stab, frankly.  If/when you do it, it\u2019ll probably need to be a \u201cfall turn stab for Bel or Nwy or Bre, build a fleet with that build\u201d kind of stab.  No England with a brain would look at a German ally building a third fleet as any ally worth keeping around.", "Yeah I get that. Now it\u2019s just a matter of timing it between who else I\u2019m attacking and when a stab is available. Don\u2019t want to overextend myself and end up trapped by England and whoever else we were just working against.", "Hey there.  1 new build and 1 rebuild.  What's the plan with those?  Any directions you are thinking about for what should happen with our neighbors?  Italy/England/Russia - is it time for us to work together, or go \"back to back\" and don't work \"together\", but pointing opposite directions (me attacking Italy or Russia, you attacking England)?  Not sure whether you want to coordinate or not, let me know!", "Hey sorry busy weekend. I don\u2019t think this is the turn for me to attack England. Don\u2019t know my plans yet though. What about you?", "If you\u2019re not going after England, I can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s a better time than now for Bal c Kie-Lvn, Ber-Pru, Mun-Sil, given that it locks War in the fall and gives a strong play for Mos.  But don\u2019t do that, it\u2019d only leave Rum and Sev for me! \ud83d\ude09", "After I didn\u2019t hear back about where all those armies were going, I worried it might be towards me, so I covered a hole in my defenses. No offense intended: if you want to coordinate with me, just let me know and we can see what works?", "I do not plan on attacking you. Can you move back away this turn. I can\u2019t use some units to attack other countries if they need to be positioned to defend against you.", "I would appreciate if you could respond soon. We can stay together as central powers.", "I\u2019m not attacking you!  But I had to move my armies into a position where they didn\u2019t scare my more vulnerable neighbors.  I had to either straight out attack Russia, or Italy, and I\u2019m not the sort to get into a war without a solid plan with an ally going with me.  Are you and England working together against Russia?  Or are you just devoting a little extra resources to hold Russia back?  I asked you last season what the coordinated plan was, but you either didn\u2019t want to share or needed to go it alone at first, which is fine, but if we want to avoid slowing each other down, we need to talk about it, even if we\u2019re not attacking the same person at the same time, you know?", "If you want to do full out war with Russia, do you need my help, or will England\u2019s be enough?  I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be successful just by yourself.  But I could instead slide south to attack Italy, who is another central power, but if I do that, I wouldn\u2019t have enough resources to *also* head north with you.", "Got it thanks. Let\u2019s come up with a plan an coordinate after the builds.", "So I understand it may take a season or two to ensure we have a safe way of collaborating (if I propose a plan now, you may not trust I'll do it, and have to tell me you'll do it, but then protect yourself instead) - I'd prefer to have a plan where we both agree on what can work, even if it means being a little slower.  For example, you might say \"I have to sit here and double-support Munich to make sure I don't lose it, but we can work together once I see I'm not under threat - just don't take too long\" or even \"I'm going to have to push back at you for this season, but as soon as you can move into Galicia we can attack Russia together from there\".  I'm open to suggestions.", "One other option, given the builds which happened: Russia built a northern fleet, so if you wanted, we could go in a different direction than attacking them - I could go south and attack Italy, and you and Russia could attack England together.  Just keeping options open...", "Thanks you I would like to rebuild trust.", "I will be holding in Mun and moving to Sil. Can you support Ber to Sil?", "Maybe you could move Vie-ADR?", "Ven-Adr definitely makes sense, as does your move to Sil.  I can move to Gal as well.", "Thank you. Glad to work together again.", "Man that sucks. Why\u2019d you do that?", "I didn't think they'd actually take it - I really just wanted to make sure Italy got into Marseille.  I'm sorry about that - obviously if I'd wanted to attack you I would have done it myself!  It should be pretty easy to repair though, right?", "Of course, you could just leave that unit in Munich for now, where you can keep an eye on it?  Once you have it surrounded, you crush it easily.  Right now if I don't support Warsaw you can get it guaranteed: Bal-Lvn cuts that support, and Sil S Pru-War gets in, if I move gal?", "Can you move to Gal?", "I\u2019m in Gal already, what do you mean?", "Sorry, are you moving Gal? Is what I meant to ask.", "You mean can I move Gal so you know it\u2019s not supporting War?", "Yeah, what is your plan for that unit?", "I was going to cover Bud because part of the reason I had to make moves dangerous for you was because Russia is all around me right now, and I need to get them not focused on taking 2-3 of my centers.  Once they are not totally hovering over me, I\u2019m more safe to actually counterattack", "Ok we\u2019ll see after this turn I suppose.", "Gal can cover Bud, Alb can cover Ser, was some of what

I\u2019m putting my kid to bed soon.", "If you order\nF Kie - Den and either\nA Mun - Ruh + A Ber - Mun Or\nA Mun - Bur + A Ber - Kie\n\nThen I can swap to\n\nF Lon - EC\nF Edi - Nth\nA Yor - Wal", "So basically a southern English opening + either a pure Anschluss or Rhineland", "I\u2019m thinking F Kie - Den, A Mun - Ruh, A Ber - Mun. I\u2019ll let you know if there are any changes but right now I\u2019m unsure about Italy\u2019s intentions.", "I would like to take Bel in 1901 if possible. Are you for sure going against France", "I thought you wanted it before 1904? I\u2019d prefer if I got Belgium initially and then could move on to France while giving Belgium to you at a later time. Would you be ok with that?", "If I can take it in 1901, I\u2019d prefer that so that I can put out a navy that can break into MAO without losing EC.\n\nWe each get 5 if we split\nGermany: Den, Hol, Swe, Par, Mar\nEngland: Nrwy, Bel, Bre, SP, Por\n\nThis split also puts my navy away from you and pushes you towards armies, which is more sustainable long-term.\n\nI said before 1904 because it is possible that France will order A Par - Pic & A Mar - Bur, or some other combination of moves that makes it near impossible for us to take Bel in 1901.", "What do you think?", "This is a partnership and I would prefer to treat it that way.", "Ok I can agree to all of that. Sounds like a plan.", "I\u2019m set to hit France.\n\nWhat have you heard from Russia about up north?", "I have an idea. You tell France that I (England) am being super rude and making all sorts of demands and you would rather not work with me, but you need France to support you (Germany) into Bel because I\u2019m convoying there and you need to build F Kie.\n\nDepending on France\u2019s response we hit some combination of Bel, Hol, and Bre.\n\nWhat do you think?", "Scratch that", "I want to hear France and Italy\u2019s reactions before we make plans for this season. I think it could help us be more efficient if we can use that to guess correctly.", "France told me you had EC as dmz and I wasn\u2019t openly aggressive so I\u2019ll pretend like I\u2019m going to side with them to get their orders.", "France told me you had EC as dmz and I wasn\u2019t openly aggressive so I\u2019ll pretend like I\u2019m going to side with them to get their orders.", "Ok", "Any thoughts?", "France is expecting you to move to Brest. Where do you think we should move?", "I\u2019m hitting Bel. You could go Bur and Hol?", "Yeah I can do that.", "I\u2019m thinking two fleets for me. Will you hold off on building a fleet this year?", "Sure I can do that this turn.", "If you can put your fleets on the west so you can get around Spain and put pressure there that\u2019d be great. Especially because France is all armies on the main area.", "And the we can talk about plans up north after builds.", "As long as Russia doesn\u2019t build A StP or F StP(NC), my plan for 1902 is to move into MAO via Irish, EC, and NwgS, with one fleet in Nth. I might be able to convoy you into pic.", "I\u2019ve been talking to some people about Russia and since I bounced them in Sweden and they don\u2019t believe my excuse I think I need to build a fleet to take to Bal.", "Can you live with that? I won\u2019t be able to make use of another army right now against France anyways.", "If you build in Ber", "I think we can lock up the north now. What do you want to do for France?", "I can hold in Hol so you can convoy that army somewhere in the fall. I can support Bel to Bur. While I move Bur to Gas.", "If Russia moves to Pru, you might have a problem if you hold A Hol.\n\nWhat do you think about\nA Bel - Pic\nA Bur S A Bel - Pic\nA Mun S A Bur H\nA Hol - Kie?", "I don\u2019t think I need to worry about Pru. Austria is pretty strong on Russia\u2019s south west.", "The rest looks good though if you\u2019re good with that plan. Still thinking about what to do with Hol. But that doesn\u2019t really affect you so much.", "What are you doing with your Norway fleet?", "F Nrwy - NwgS", "Ok I\u2019m moving A Hol - Kie.", "What are your plans?", "I\u2019m thinking A Bur-Mar if I can get Italy on board. A Mun-Bur. What do you want to do?", "What are your plans?", "I am trying to get Italy to support me Bur-Mar but they think Par will be supporting Bre rather than cutting my support from Bur-Mar. Anything you could say to them to convince them to support me into Mar?", "I\u2019ll try to think of something to say", "Thanks.", "I don\u2019t really know what to tell him that would convince him to support you in. He\u2019s in the better support position but he has to realize that he needs the center more than he needs France dead", "You have any ideas?", "Bur-Gas, Mun-Bur. And then I can take it myself next year.", "Any thoughts? What are your plans?", "Scratch that last plan. Italy is going to support me into Mar.", "What are you doing?", "Sorry, my birthday is today and I was at dinner.", "I think I\u2019m going to shoot for Bre, just in case it\u2019s open. If I\u2019m bounced in MAO, then that means France won\u2019t be getting a center.", "Happy birthday! Hope it\u2019s been a good one!", "Yeah that plan is what I was thinking too.", "What\u2019s your next move? I think if you generally swing around Spain toward Italy while I work on Russia in the north we can finish off France and move on to our next targets.", "I agree. I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t build another fleet right now. Would that be ok?", "Yeah sorry I didn\u2019t respond before adjudication but that was my plan. Figured you wouldn\u2019t want me to build fleets.", "In return for me not having fleets could you avoid NTH?", "I\u2019d like to discuss who we can attack next as well since France is on the ropes.", "I\u2019ll move F Edi - NwgS then Nrwy. I\u2019m keeping F Bel there in case France retreats.\n\nI say we\u2019re close to stabbing Italy and Austria. Russia is not in a position to fight back and never will be with turkey so messed up. What do you think?", "I was thinking maybe I take on Russia and you work towards Italy. It will be a little longer of a route for you but will help you secure the West.", "Would you mind leaving StP open until I take it? Having only one unit bordering Nrwy would help keep things stable", "So like don\u2019t go to stp?", "What are your plans for this turn?", "I\u2019m setting myself up for Iberia.\n\nIf you take StP, I\u2019d very much prefer that you did it by taking StP(SC) instead of using an army. That way we can maintain stability in the north", "Can I have your support into Paris? I\u2019d also like to ask how we were planning on dividing France so as to keep things balanced?", "I thought we discussed you get Par and Mar and I get Bre + the Iberian.\n\nCan you take Mar instead?", "What are you planning on this turn?", "What\u2019s the deal with Austria?", "If I get Par and Mar, can you not support me from Bre?", "Need to talk to Austria but they\u2019re claiming defensive positioning after not responding in time to messages.", "Please don\u2019t take StP with an army.", "I\u2019m not planning on it. And I really doubt I\u2019d be able to with Russia picking up 2 centers in Turkey.", "Oh, I missed that. Is Austria going to start sniping Italy?", "Im talking with them but unsure right now. I got myself in a bind when I fell asleep the other night when negotiating with Austria and they moved toward me. I hope they\u2019ll draw back and choose to go after Russia or Italy next but I doubt it\u2019ll be Russia based on their collaboration to finish Turkey off faster.", "Yeah, I think we can hold against Russia with what we have up there. Austria might be tricky.", "Can you keep moving fleets toward the Mediterranean after France falls to prepare for fighting Austria? I have a feeling Italy will fall soon after France unless Austria just chooses another target.", "I\u2019ll move some, but I need to keep a couple back to keep you honest and maintain control of Nth. This is why I\u2019ve been so pushy about your fleet production and keeping armies out of StP/Fin. If you don\u2019t build fleets, then I don\u2019t have to keep people in the rear.", "Understood. I\u2019ve already selected my build to be an army. I don\u2019t want to do anything that makes either of us hold back from our adversaries any more than necessary just to cover a potential stab.", "And Austria is about to smack Mun, which is unfortunate.\n\nShould I go ahead and dump a fleet into StP so that you can take Mos?", "Let\u2019s hold briefly while we wait to see builds. But that might be necessary.", "F Bel H\n\nWhat do you think about\nA Bre - Gas\nF ENG - MAO\nF MAO - Naf\nF NTH - Nwy\nF WES S MAO - Naf\n\nAnd then you order\nF Swe - Fin\nA Kie - Swe\nF Bal C A Kie - Swe\n\nThat\u2019s a risky move, but I don\u2019t know how to keep A Liv alive without leaving Pru open as a retreat area, and there\u2019s no point in leaving A Kie boxed in.", "Any thoughts?", "I like your moves. I\u2019m worried this will over commit me toward Russia right when Austria is at my doorstep. If it the right time to push further East?", "I share your concern", "Can you s A bre - has", "Yes you have my support.", "Obviously I meant gas instead of gas, but I think you already figured that out", "A Par - Bur\nF Bal Kie\nA Sil - Mun\nA Ber S A Sil - Mun\nA Ruh S A Sil - Mun\n\nWhat do you think?", "?", "Yes I\u2019ll do most of that besides BAL -Kiel.", "What are your plans?", "A Mun could retreat to Kie", "Ah thanks. Completely overlooked that.", "Just trying to figure out the Mediterranean right now.", "If you put A Par - Bur, you\u2019ll be in a good place to take mar next year", "Yeah I\u2019m moving Par-Mar.", "Are you trying to take Iberia first? Or push into the med against Italy?", "Do you know anything about what Italy is planning? I\u2019m debating what moves I should do first, but I don\u2019t know if Italy is going to cover Tun", "Not sure yet. I\u2019ve talked a little with Italy but nothing sure yet. I\u2019ll let you know if I find out before the deadline.", "Thanks", "Italy is planning on taking WES this turn. And they want to use France as a distraction to keep you occupied. That\u2019s all I could get out of them.", "Hey what do you want to do this turn?", "Unless we can get Russia on our side, we are going to lose. I\u2019m not going to be able to hold the stalemate line in the south and it\u2019s lost up north.", "I think you should move F Swe - Bot as a bounce before you delete the unit.", "Yeah have you talked to Russia any?", "I tried", "I goofed. I forgot to change F EC - Nth to F EC - MAO", "I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve doomed us.", "Well the end is near. No worries. I\u2019ll help you try to make a stand. I definitely don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it to 1910 but you still have a chance.", "Oh well. You need to get Italy to recognize the Austrian threat or get Russia on our side. He\u2019s mad at you for moving to Liv forever ago.", "Yeah that was a stupid decision on my part and I doubt I can sway him now that he and Austria have momentum.", "I\u2019m so happy that Italy didn\u2019t retreat to Mao", "Do you need anything from me", "Will you be able to check back later tonight? I\u2019m working until like 10.", "I\u2019ll try to remember. I\u2019m usually in bed by 10.", "Nothing too particular. But if you want to send a fleet for Norway we can try for StP next move?", "Sure", "Cool thanks. Let me know if you need anything from me.", "I\u2019ll support Gas - Mar. Anything else you want to do?", "Sorry I forgot to move so you could take StP.", "No problem. I\u2019ve ordered A Gas - Mar.", "I\u2019m building an army in Edi to convoy to Nrwy.", "Is that ok?", "Ok cool that works for me.

I\u2019m often a big fan of the A/R alliance: Turkey is a great initial target, Germany second, with Italy coming next after that for me and England next for you.  Lots of possibilities!  Any thoughts?", "Greeings Austria!\n\nI agree the old Jug is a little obvious, I do believe that A/R is a lot more flexible for both of us ! \n\nHow do you envision a 1901?", "We could bounce in Gal, as that\u2019s a fairly safe way to maintain those two units in a rearguard position, for starters.  Then there\u2019s Turkey: if I can convince them that you\u2019re going north so that they can move quickly with their fleets with me (ie Ank-Con) then you could just *take* BLA, which would speed up this whole endeavor right away.  If we don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do that (or you don\u2019t want to lie in 01), you two could just bounce there and go to Mos-Ukr while I go to Ser, then in the Fall you could either take Rum with the fleet (so you can force BLA), or else I support you into Rum from Ukr while going for BLA again.  Of course, Italy goes Trl and Ven right out of the gate, I won\u2019t be as useful an ally to you ;p", "Any thoughts on 1901 moves?  Germany and Italy both seem content to play cautiously (so they say: the Anschluss \"hold in Munich\" from Germany, and \"how about a Lepanto?\" from Italy), and Turkey is making friendly sounds but nothing concrete.  You feeling like the typical \"3 units south\" approach, so we can pick apart Turkey? I don't seen any obvious E/G fighting right out of the gate to give you an easy opening into Scandanavia (as cool as that would be - A/R alliances where R gets in the west early can do some fun things...)", "Agreed on the bounce in Gal. Yeah if you can convince turkey to move F to Con that would be great!", "Are you worried that Italy will disrupt you this spring?", "Italian 1901 moves are a wildcard.  I think they want to take it cautious, which means I\u2019d have a tiny bit of breathing room, but if you were Italy and wanted to dive into Austria, wouldn\u2019t you tell them you wanted to move cautiously, too? ;p", "Yeah fair, what are your 1901 plans then? Going for Serbia and keeping Trip defended might be the way to go then?", "Wow the west looks way more fun than what we\u2019re all doing!", "Ha how's that?", "England gets into the channel with the aggressive convoy from Wales option, Germany puts two on Bur, and France weirdly decides to launch an army into the east.  Things will move fast over there.", "Of course we could slow things down for them if it starts to look out of hand.  And we (you, especially) need to watch a nascent E/G alliance.  I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to do some fun stuff too \ud83d\ude42  We should talk to France so they don\u2019t crumble too quickly.", "Wait dumby question im used to playdip. Why does the board show some people's spring moves and not others", "Yeah that Germany/English alliance is looking pretty formidable. Looks like we do have An anti-Turkish Italy which could be useful. We need France to give E/G a fight. It'd be nice for us to get Sweden, but im looking pretty outgunned to the North.", "The board shows me everyone\u2019s moves, did you go back a season to see the moves, or are you only looking at the current position?", "I see the board now, It just showed me everyones moves but Turkeys and mine it was weird", "That is definitely odd!", "At least you have no worries about an English army in Nwy, right next to StP.  How did you want to play Rum?  Tell Turkey you\u2019re supporting your fleet into there, and if they stab you by taking BLA in the fall, you\u2019ll build F Sev in the winter to force them right back out?  Totally valid defensive threat, and maybe convinces them to leave Ank where it is?", "Yeah that would be a good play! Are you going for the second build in Greece, not sure how that will play out with Italy and Turkey. I'm debating whether or not to go for Sweden or send my fleet South", "I\u2019m definitely going for Gre: Italy can\u2019t guarantee a build without taking Tunis, which keeps Ion from being involved in Gre in any direction.  Turkey may not feel like letting me have Gre... but I can support myself in, so they can\u2019t really stop it either.", "Yeah you need Greece, agreed. What if I tell Turkey that I will sup their bulgarian army into rum, which will then free up your army in serbia to actaully support me into rum. Then your albanian fleet gets greece for free", "Do you think Turkey will believe that?  We could try, but I\u2019d hate to go for Gre unsupported and have Turkey decide at the last minute the they don\u2019t trust you, or want to keep me from getting Gre.  Let\u2019s sound them out and see whether we can tell what they\u2019re likely to do, and go from there?", "Sounds good", "Supporting you into Rum will show my hand as your ally, but that has to happen at some point.  If I do that, do I have your assurance that in exchange, next season you'll do: Rum S Ser-Bul, so we can squeeze them back into their homeland?  We'll need that to succeed in Spring so that in case they get into Aeg they can't stop it for the fall.", "Hey so let me know what you think about fall plans, when you get a chance- although I imagine you\u2019re hopefully having much more fun doing some New Year\u2019s party or something \ud83d\ude42", "Looks like we only have 13 hrs until adjudication- quick timetable on this game, I guess!", "In case you\u2019re out partying and only read this while I\u2019m asleep: if your good with my offer (I support you into Rum now, you support Ser-Bul next season), then it\u2019s a deal.  Also: since you didn\u2019t ask for any particular plans in the War/Vie/Gal/Boh/Sil region, I\u2019m going to assume a \u201cbounce-enforced-DMZ\u201d of Gal is still in effect, and we can do that again. If you\u2019re planning instead on poking at Germany to remind them to be nice about Swe, I can instead cover Trieste.  I could see how F Bal + A Pru could wreck havoc on a German position where their fleet has landed way up in Sweden. Kie + Ber + Den sitting kinda wide open.  Just let me know, or else we can stick with another bounce for now.", "Yeah sounds good", "so that's a yes for \"I get you Rum, you help support me into Bul next season\",  and \"let's stay off of Germany's doorstep for now, fight one war at a time\", yeah? \ud83d\ude42", "and I *assume* you meant you want support for Ukr-Rum, since you're doing Sev-Bla to keep Turkey out, right?  Because you didn't actually say which unit you were sending to Rum... would be very sad to order a support for the wrong unit, y'know?", "Yeah I\u2019m not going to poke Germany. Sup my army, in moving into BlA with my fleet. You\u2019ll get bul next season \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "cool. that's what I had ordered already, but glad to confirm.", "wow, I'm glad I picked you to work with, and not Turkey.  I really hate picking allies who can't get their orders in!", "As a consequence, you can build Sev and force Arm in spring and crush Bul at the same time, and in fall 02, bul-con ensures that Con S Ank is cut, and Bla S Arm-Ank succeeds and the turk ends '02 on 2 dots.", "Seems like you made a bit of a mis-order on War-Gal, though - that wasn't intentional, was it?  I didn't want to *be* in Gal, I just wanted it empty.  I can try to get out of your way there... but its going to be a bit crowded after the builds.", "Oh yeah sorry about that I don't know what went wrong, yeah I guess try to evacuate that unit so it can actually be useful to us. Trying to decide whether to build north or south rn...", "Want to plan a german offensive? It looks like we have a lot of free units that could attack them", "two fronted war?  Do we maybe want to pin down Turkey so they're unable to become a threat first, pick up one more build from them each?  Plan for that: build in Sev, then do F Bla S Sev-Arm in spring, and F Bla S Sev-Ank in fall.  Meanwhile, Rum+Gre S Ser-Bul in spring, and in fall, I hit Bul-Con to cut their support, so that Ank is unsupported in the fall, and we get both Bul+Ank in one year.  One build for each of us, Turkey's down to 2 centers and can't cause much trouble (even behind us), and we can turn our attention more easily on Germany?  We could use our rearguard units to push up on the German line now, but to actually break through, requires a ton of force: we really need Trl+Boh+Sil+Pru to ensure we crack Mun+Ber, unless they leave themselves totally undefended.  Even just 2 armies back there and it's slow going, and they can pull Hol-Kie to fill in another support in one move.  I'm game, but it seems maybe a year early?", "Oh I didn\u2019t see they build a fleet in Berlin... this means they\u2019ll force Swe and put pressure on StP- unless you can convince them to work with you against England instead.  Once the push fleets like that, they\u2019ll be way out of position and yeah we can crack them.  Maybe we can afford to push sooner... we should consider some tactics... I could perhaps be convinced.", "So in theory, if we did the whole \"AIR-head\" alliance, we *could* blitz westward all at once now: Vie-Boh, Gal-Sil, War-Pru, Ven-Trl.  All three of us go after germany now, and in the fall, we make supported attacks on both Munich and Berlin.  One has to fall, and if they aren't careful in spring, both could in the same year.  The problem with that kind of plan is it requires tons of trust for you, me and Italy.  You have to trust me to not dive right in to Warsaw as you walk out, Italy has to trust leaving their entire homeland totally undefended, and I have to launch a two front war where my two allies could just coordinate instead walking Ven-Tri + Tun-Ion-Alb while you do War-Gal as I'm getting out of the way.  Fun kind of things to do when trust has been built, but I don't know y'all one bit, yet. \ud83d\ude42", "so since I'm not sure I want to commit to jumping all over Germany just yet, I want to make sure you don't stress about my \"bored\" armies: my orders will involvee Vie H, Gal-Bud, as well as the Gre S Ser-Bul while you do Rum S Ser-Bul as well, ok?  Italy will have a unit F Eas after this move, and will be convoying the army over to peel apart Smy and help you into Arm to take Ank.  If you want to leave Gal open for now, we can keep it as a DMZ so you don't need to worry about Ukr or anything like that.  Unless you have any other concrete plans you'd prefer to do, that is.", "Yeah I am totally on board for your proposal that gets us one build each this round from turkey. i was juts saying we should start moving into Germany's territory, without making a full attack yet. Gal-Boh and Vie-Tyr could set us up for that next turn. As for working with Italy, that is an option but how much have you been talking with them so far? Yeah any ideas to the north for retaining StP?", "Yeah sounds good to me. How will gal move to budapest since theres an army already there? Also how have negotaitions with italy gone? Do they expect Smy? or Con?", "Gal-Bud, Bud-Ser, Ser-Bul, Gre S Ser-Bul.  The latter succeeds as long as you hold up your end of the bargain and order Rum S Ser-Bul.  You mis-order that, or \"forget\", and I am not able to get out of your way in Gal. :p", "RE: Con/Smy/Ank: I've talked to Italy, and they're going for Smy, and will support me into Con, and if you need it (you won't, by then) I'll support you into Ank.  A nice 3-way split of Turkey.", "Ofc Im not looking to break our alliance anytime soon XD. A dual win is very possible for us...", "RE: StP.  That's tricky.  If you send War north to help you hold it (which it will, for a year or two, until they bring all three of those fleets to bear at once), you're using the army which we'd want to be useful in Sil/Pru.  As long as you cover StP now, they can't take it from you this year.  They get Swe this year, and spring of next year they move into position, and then finally in fall they have 2-3 units in position to take StP.  By then we should be able to make them think twice about that, either by backing up StP with some army strength, or else losing it temporarily while we push against Mun+Ber on land.", "To your second point im not entirely sure about 2 builds for you, one for me, and one for italy (long term that is). Could I have Con and then give you smy next year? That would leave me with 1 more army the you, but that seems fair since im a lot more spread", "RE: StP, yeah ill keep negotiating with E/G and if i can't get anywhere with them ill go for the protect StP at all costs> I think I might be able to play one against the other though", "Long term, we don\u2019t need Italy, no.  In fact we can probably just take Smy from them the very year after they get it: if Turkey is dead and Italy has lots of fleets, they\u2019ll be going after France, which only strengthens E/G further which we don\u2019t want.", "But as for current plans, we already splitting equally: I supported you into Rum (wasn\u2019t needed, but I ordered it and that told Turkey I was their enemy, that cost me something), so you agreed to one season\u2019s worth of support for me to get Bul: an even trade.  Then I\u2019ll make sure to keep tapping Con each season to cut support for Ank, which gets you that one, which would mean a fair trade after that is Con for me, which I won\u2019t need your support for, just your permission that I can take it for myself and we\u2019re still good.  Italy taking Smy on their own helps both of us, because it gets rid of a unit which can support Con or Ank.  Once this stuff is done, however, I\u2019m open to giving you Smy, especially if we\u2019re both moving against Germany and splitting Mun/Ber for the two of us.", "But if you see it differently, let me know. Diplomacy is the name of the game, and it\u2019s not a compromise unless everyone is equally  unhappy \ud83d\ude09", "Fair  but the one thing for us to consider is if I get to builds this year I can put them to the north and two fleets would be the perfect support for out German invasion in the following year", "A fleet in the north would be *awesome*, yes.  If it looks like we have a chance at making sure that happens, I\u2019m definitely interested in trying to help that become a reality.  That totally opens up stalemate lines which otherwise get locked down.", "Looks like Turkey has to choose this next season: block Arm, or Syr.  Can\u2019t do both. I\u2019ll be in Aeg to make sure Turkey cracks open totally next year.  I\u2019m moving my armies a little south as well, to help them from worrying you \ud83d\ude42", "And yeah, you\u2019re going to need two builds from Turkey sooner rather than later.  That should be doable pretty quickly.", "In fact, I\u2019m a bit worried about your western border already.  If you want to watch your back, and send that Rumanian army through the Gal DMZ so that you have two units covering War (in case Germany thinks about: Mun-Sil + Bal C Kie-Pri - yikes!), I\u2019m cool with that if it\u2019s just passing through for defensive reasons.", "Yeah that is a little worrying. Should I just sup my Sev army inot Arm again?", "If you want to ensure you own Ank at the end of next year, I think you need to do that supported attack again, yes.  If you're worried about Germany and want to redeploy west, that's fine too, but it'll make it slower to get you a Turkish build.", "If I were you, I'd send the Rumanian army to cover your western flank and keep hammering at Turkey so you can get builds (first Ank next year, then like we discussed, you can have Smy: we'll have to steal it from Italy, which may mean I need to stab them, and if I do that, I won't be able to simultaneously fight against Germany as much with you, but we can figure that out when we get to it)", "Maybe Turkey forgot to order again... then they\u2019ll lose all three of their units next season (and we\u2019ll be able to get you Ank and Smy *both* next year).  Make sure your orders are submitted just in case!", "Awesome: the Turk chose to defend Syria not Arm.  Attacks on Con and Smy ensure you get Ank in spring.  Good to see England backed off in the north, nice diplomatic work on your part \ud83d\ude42", "hey things look pretty straightforward in the south: we both do supported attacks on Ank + Con, and Smy can only support one.  The other is destroyed in Spring.  Then in fall, whoever got in supports the other attack, and we get one build each next year.", "Sounds good I plan on moving in on ank. what are your orders for bul and greece? Moving ser-trip coould set up a free build from italy this turn as well. Also any ideas on keepung france around a little longer. Germand  and England don't seem that close", "Also, I've heard intel that Germany is moving on us now. I suggest Vie-Boh and bringing your other units north would help us have the perfect counterattack for the following year when we get reinforcements", "Yeah, moving two units back to Vie and Boh, now, and I would frankly be very worried, if I were you, of this: F Bal C Kie-Lvn, Ber-Pru, Mun-Sil.  That would crack War in one season and put huge pressure Mos.", "But if Germany does that, I\u2019ll be ready to put pressure on them in Boh at least.", "are you going to cover against Germany too?", "Nice save, in the north! And if Turkey messes up in the fall, you get both builds from Ank and Smy in one year.  Plus I\u2019m covering your butt by moving to Boh so that Mun won\u2019t go to Sil, so you\u2019re looking pretty good! I\u2019m going to need that build from Con this year, to get a second fleet: England is coming!", "Yeah, Im glad I got the bounce to the north or i'd be in real trouble. Wait I don't think turkey even has to make a mistake. If I sup you into con from BLA than that prevents con from suping SMY from my two pronged attack from ank and arm", "If Turkey orders con-ank, that cuts support of Ank s arm-smy.  If you attack the other way, arm s Ank-smy, you\u2019ll get into smy, but con-Ank will recapture Ank.", "If you do Bla s Ank, Ank s arm-smy, you keep Ank but again con-Ank cuts support for your attack on smy.", "However: Aeg s Arm-Smy, Bla s Bul-Con *is* guaranteed, now that I look closer!  They have no fleets to cut either support now, so if we do that, then all three Turkish centers drop this turn! I missed that in my earlier analysis, thanks for making me dig into it again!", "Can you take a look and make sure I\u2019m reading the tactics on that correctly?", "Yeah that's right! We should have the turk out of the game in the winter. You have my support from BLA into Con which guarantees your build, but to guarantee mine could you sup army in Arm into Smy with your AEG fleet? Bc otherwise Turkey has a shot of surviving if he cuts support from ank", "Aeg S Arm-Smy and Bul-Con are both already ordered \ud83d\ude42", "You should make sure to leave both StP and Mos open for your two builds.  I\u2019m building F Tri (I\u2019ll need it in the Mediterranean). Are you building a northern fleet now while you have a chance?", "F Tri for me, A Mos for you, so F StP(sc) to back up your other fleet and keep England happy, or F StP(nc) to get one out up top before you get bottled in?", "Sounds about right", "You decide on whether you'll do south coast, or north?  Looks like you've managed to avoid war with England up until now, so probably south coast?", "Yeah prob either south coast or army. Im thinking an army could be good since I already have one fleet there", "yeah an army can sneak around in Nwy/Fin easier too.", "I've played this game a long time, and I don't remember the last time I saw an A/R alliance with both Austria and Russia building fleets in 1903.  That is the sign of an extremely well-functioning alliance for primarily land-based powers. \ud83d\ude42", "Hell yeah man were doing well! How should we coordinate the German offensive this year?", "I am going to support France into Munich.  You should push them back to Prussia, right?  I have a little concern that if they go into Sil, we will have a hole in our line - Galicia.  What should we do about that?  Either I can go there, or you can convoy an army from turkey up to Rum, and go into Gal the season after that.  Either way, one of us should transit through Gal towards the front lines.", "We can drain our units out of Turkey at the same rate, so we both are safe over there, and get our units where we can make use of them.", "Okay sounds good ill pull the  ank army to fill the hole. Would it be valuable to pull that Con army up into the fold? Also I love the support france into Mun play. As for ejecting Germnays foothold in Lvn, I think I march from Moscow right?", "I will definitely bring Con out of  there, but do you mind if it waits a season, so that we evacuate Turkey at the same rate? You\u2019ve got 2 units there now, and I\u2019ve got 1. After this season it\u2019ll be one each, and we can pull them out at the same time?  Just helps us both worry less about any asymmetry.", "Mos-Lvn, StP and War supports the move, GoB-Bal cuts the possibility of Bal s Lvn, seems like the right set of northern moves?", "Re: Turkey- if you want to move faster, we could: I could move my con out now if you are moving both your armies out: Ank-Rum and smy-arm?", "So actually I\u2019m not going to stress about Turkey: I\u2019ll trust you and move con-Bul and I suggest you move smy-arm to get that into play as well.  I think I need to go to Gal in case Germany goes to Sil and also retreats lvn-pru- you\u2019ll need extra support to hold War if Germany has pru + sil and can cut Lvn with their fleet.", "I can shuffle Gal out of your way so you can get Rum in place to support your own unit, unless you want me to keep Gal there for now?  You could bring your other army around, and move Rum-Ukr?  Either way, if you want to do Rum-Gal, let me know and I will move out of the way.", "What are your thoughts?  Seems like a key season for coordination.", "I think Ill move Rum-Gal if your cool shuffling. I'll start moving Smy into the fold as well. Want to move Greece to Ion so we have another fleet in the Med?", "Since were still bringing units up, I think I will prob not be making any offensives up north unless you have any ideas?", "Yep I'll get Gal out of the way and let you get up there to support yourself in the push toward Berlin.  As for moves, Bot-Bal, War S Lvn-Pru, Lvn-Pru might succeed if I ask France (who owes me a favor) to tap Sil?  Or you could counter attack next season after you have Gal in place.", "Yeah lets push Germany out of Pru. Ask France to tap Berlin though bc you can tap Sil with Boh. Then we can disband Pru if im looking at this right", "I am probably moving Aeg-Ion to hold England off, yes.  And good point re: Sil/Ber.  I'm feeling a little exposed in the Balkans, though.  I may need to cover my butt those southern armies - I would hate for our alliance to fall apart because you noticed shiny dots sitting undefended!", "Yeah likewise. I mean to be fair as long as we don't stab each other I think we have the dual win in the bag at this point, which kinda of discourages betrayal. What are you thinking as far as covering rn? To be fair I'm relatively exposed too", "Well if I'm leaving Aeg, you'll have no worries about Smy, but I'm looking at Bul and Ser.  Hey maybe if you're not doing anything with Bla this season, we could do Gre-Bul, Bla-Bul(ec), and we'd bounce.  My dot would be safe, and we'd keep the good position we're in, and I wouldn't be any closer to Rum, so you'd still be safe in leaving it for Gal.", "I'm not sure about Ser.  I guess I won't worry about it, because if you stabbed me for it, you'd have an army sitting all alone in the middle of my territory, and would not last long.", "Agreed on the bounce. Although that wont work next season bc I will convoy that last army into the fold.", "Should I also ask France for the cut, or would it be more effective to leave that to you?", "we can work out a different bounce if we need it, or maybe we will be just less entangled and won't need to worry about it then.", "I asked them already.", "and reminded them that their help here is ensuring that their enemy has to enemies pushing on them hard.  Plus, I don't think Mun is under threat right now.", "France is tapping Berlin, so I\u2019ll tap Sil and you tap Bal and you should be able to crush Pru!", "So, some thoughts on strategy, beyond small tactics: we can keep Italy working with us for another year, but I think if we want to push forward, we need yet another fleet each.  I could take two dots off of Italy next year, keep one build for myself and one you could take from me in Con.  The real key for us, long term, is to get into Bur, Ruh, and fleets in the north", "you forgot to bounce me in Bul!  Not the end of the world, but I didn't want to be in Bul.  We may need to put off killing Italy for a little while - they're gaining position against England, and the more tied up in the south that England is, the less ability they have to help you out Germany against you in the north.  Have you thought of offering to support them into Sweden?  It would be amazing for us if G/E started fighting...", "You might want to move your Ank army up too Mos, instead of Gal, btw: if you can cover StP with an army, it would free up that fleet to dig in against Den/Swe/Kie/Ber.", "Yeah sounds good Ill move that ank army up to cover mos/stp. Ill ask england if they want support into Swe. So should we wait on attacking Italy this year or not? Im not partial either way, but I agree that once we do you should give me some of your builds in the back as you gain from italy. That way i can have some new fleets to make gains to the north", "I indeed thinking on holding off on attacking Italy this year, because they are likely to make progress against England.  And yes, if we\u2019re not getting you builds in Germany and I *am* getting builds in Italy, we need you building in the Atlantic, which I can\u2019t do, for sure!  Similarly, if I can break through in France and need builds and you\u2019re getting some in Germany - you\u2019d do the same for me! \ud83d\ude42", "Spring: Boh-Mun (cut their use of that for support), Tri S Vie-Trl, Vie-Trl, Bul-Gre.  You do War S Gal-Sil, Gal-Sil, Pru S Bal-Ber.  This *forces* Germany to do Kie S Ber or else Berlin falls in Spring.  If they do hold Berlin for spring, they lose it in the fall, because Sil can be the mover while Bal cuts Kiel and Pru supports the move, uncuttably.  Fall we possibly also have the option of asking Italy to do Mar-Bur which cuts that support, and then Trl+Boh+Sil to take Mun.  Or that can wait for the next season.  Looking pretty good!", "Any thoughts for moves?  Running out of time, let's not lose momentum!", "Sounds good! Yeah ill take Sil, threaten Ber, and bring that ank unit north.", "Alright well Berlin fell quicker than expected. I'm thinking of moving the sev army into Mos, which should allow me to send my StP fleet to Bot.", "I think a quick seizure of Scandinavia will prevent Britain from saving Germany from our ground invasion. That's why i think i should move my Berlin fleet back out to BAL, and replace it with my prussian army (supported by sil just to make sure). then I can move warsaw into prussia to cover that territory.", "I think this line of play is in our best inetrsts but I wanted to run it by you to see if you think either of those moves into the baltic sea seemed to risky", "Lvn is critical yes.  And Mos.  Berlin is trickier: we can retake the typically hard to capture Munich now with: Ber-Kie, Mar-Bur, Sil+Boh+Trl work together to force Mun", "If they knew how to play this game, they\u2019d see that coming and do this: Kie s Mun-Ber, Swe-Bal.  that would evaporate Ber in exchange for losing Mun.  But to avoid losing the fleet you could shuffle Pru out of the way to leave it open for a retreat space.  Or, let them evaporate it, and rebuild F StP(*NC*) which would totally screw them", "With a mos, f stp(nc), they are so sunk in Scandinavia", "So we could put your Sil army in Munich if you\u2019d like and then Berlin is still easy next year. Yeah I think that\u2019s best: get you Munich for the north coast build, save Pru as a retreat space as well: Pru-Sil to get out of the way in case Ber has to retreat and Bal is taken", "France is on board to do Mar-Bur.  So we can get you Munich (and if Germany isn't very smart, you'll have both Munich *and* Berlin)", "I\u2019ve already put in orders for Boh and Trl S Sil-Mun", "Sounds good!", "arggggg!  I told you to do F StP-Lvn, not GoB.  Now you can't build in StP - if you'd gone to Lvn, you'd have fleets in Ber + Lvn + StP, and more easily able to protect against England who will bee convoying an army to Nwy next season (if they have any brains at all)", "other than supporting Munich, do need anything from me this season?  I have ideas about the North, but I'll let you ask if you want any advice \ud83d\ude09", "(but I can't help myself: StP -> Fin is unlikely to be blocked, and then you can do A War S Mos-Lvn, A Mos-Lvn, A Sev-Mos, A Sil S Ber.  What do you think?  Too safe?  Better to make some risks?)", "In the south, I'm just putting myself in position to replace Italy's units while England floods into the Med.  If you can't get a foothold in Scandanavia, England will be leading this board in 1910...", "Ok thanks I think ill do that, sorry for not responding my messages havnt been sending for the last week", "Oh nice!  StP open for F StP(nc)!!!", "So England is totally overcommitted in the south, and yet cannot break my stalemate line (I don't think they understand that though).  Your new northern fleet is going to be a pain in their butt, keeping them pinned down protecting Nwy.  I have a plan to get you another northern unit, but it requires being clever: you move Bla-Bul, and I use my two new armies to dislodge you from there, and you retreat off the board and rebuild up in StP (maybe south coast, this time, so you have 3 fleets against Germany's 2, and you can capture Bal and break through their lines to capture Den or Kie?).  Other than that, the only option is hoping you guess cleverly and/or E/G screw up.  Getting you an extra unit up there seems the most efficient, and your F Bla isn't doing us much good anymore.", "Sounds good ill move Bla-Bul. Should I attempt the Fin sup Stp into NWY?", "I thought about Fin+StP, but then I remembered about coasts: Fin *can't* support an attack on Nwy: it's a fleet, and can only support an attack on a province it could itself move to, so that support is invalid \ud83d\ude26", "so I'd instead go for GoB, which would force Swe S Bal, and allow you to instead do GoB c Lvn-Fin, and then you *do* have a unit which can support an attack on Nwy.", "Oh hey, I forgot - Mun/Ber.  Just want support or are you shuffling units around for better placement?", "Because if you wanted, you could do Mun-Ber, Ber-Pru, Sil-Mun, and I can support Sil-Mun to make sure you keep it, but you'd have a spring risk you'd lose Ber, and need to recapture in the fall...", "But if I don't hear from you, I'll assume you just want support for Munich.", "Sounds good ill grab BOT, and I think i will go for the grand shuffle. So please support sil-mun", "two supports ordered for Sil-Mun.", "Although, looking at the way Germany plays:  Munich is less likely to be attacked than Berlin.  If you wanted, you could just leave it open for a season and do Sil S Mun-Ber.  Then when Germany does Bal S Kie-Ber, you\u2019ll both bounce but you\u2019ll have shuffled Ber safely back to Pru.  Then in the fall, you can do Pru + Mun S Sil-Ber, and it\u2019s 3 vs 2 you get in with the army, and can concentrate the fleets on the Swe/Fin area.  I\u2019ll support whichever you choose though. It\u2019s your risk, your choice", "Ok, I'm doing Rum-Bul, Ser S Rum-Bul to get rid of that southern fleet and if you can retake Ber, rebuild.  I think you can crush Berlin: Pru + Sil S Mun-Ber, Bot-Bal cuts off their retreat.  The only way they guess their way out of it is to explicitly run away from Ber: Ber-Bal, Swe S Ber-Bal, which would be weird.  Their fleet getting crushed would really screw them though.  You'd wreak havoc on Kie/Den/Swe if they only had one fleet.  The other guess you could do is Sil S Mun-Ber, Pru S Gob-Bal.  If they try to run away and you do that, again: their fleet is crushed.  So I guess you now have a 50/50 guess at totally wrecking the german fleet! \ud83d\ude42", "Ummm... please try to at least put in provisional orders next time.  Kinda wrecks the game for you allies when you NMR :/", "And do remember to disband F Bul instead of retreating... the rest of our northern line depends on those units existing where they are...", "Of course part of this is my fault!  Apparently my order change to put in double support for Mun didn\u2019t go through- it saved the version where I supported Sil-Mun :/", "Yeah apologies for that one, I will not miss another step", "If you do GoB s Pru-Bal, War-Pru , Sil s War-Pru and they work, Germany will be pretty toast", "Let me know what you want Boh + Trl to do. You can clearly retake Mun or Ber.", "Im sending pru to bal and war to prussia, so probably cant take ber or mun this season", "Ok, sounds good.  Make sure to use GoB to support Pru-Bal, in that case!", "Ah I would be pretty mad about the stab but I did kind deserve it with that missed set of orders last year. Are you splitting with Germany or England? If it's both ill prob just surrender", "We could probably end the game as a 3-way tie EGA at the end of the year.  Sorry about the stab... I had gotten kinda bogged down and we were running out of time.  In a non- time limited game I would\u2019ve been more patient (our A/R position was still better)", "Did England say stupid shit to piss you off? I\u2019d have thought you\u2019d disband the fleets and slam into me to \u201cpunish my stab\u201d?  Not that I\u2019m complaining!  If you care, I\u2019m happy to support your last unit or two to survive the game at the end, so that England can\u2019t have the satisfaction of eliminating you...", "Ha no, my thought process after a stab is more survival than revenge. Yeah that would be sick, which unit(s) do you want to keep alive?", "they can't take A Mos without my help, if either you or I are in Warsaw.", "so depending on how we get there, if it turns out you have both, great.  If it turns out that I have War (and Sev/Ukr underneath) I'll be supporting you in Mos (and hoping you use that unit to support War)", "I\u2019m supporting Lvn-War and also tapping Silesia, if you

I tend to love A/T alliances, with Austria building lots of armies and Turkey going mostly fleets (because breaking through to the Ionian Sea can be pretty hard otherwise).  We could go after Russia first, and once they\u2019re weakened, turn some force on Italy as well.  Lots of loot to split up and keep us both happy for quite some time... what do you think?", "I think that idea would work very well. You will most likely need to get a truce with Italy for the first few phases to protect your back until I can get ships in the area.", "Sounds good - *if* I Italy is not lying to me, I could get that truce.  What do you think we should do with Russia then?

But if he\u2019s cagey and careful, it\u2019ll go slower.", "That sounds good to me.

One strategy I've sometimes found useful when getting tag-teamed by forces more numerous than my own: ask a neighbor to come to your aid, with the promise that if I start to collapse, I'll let that neighbor take my centers to spike those who are attacking me.  In this case, you could ask Italy to move Ven-Pie, so that they can support Marseille, or if you're really struggling at some point, they can take it from you and use that to help you hold E+G at bay until they inevitably start fighting each other.

That is unfortunate.", "So I guess you can retreat to Gas, and decide whether to keep all three of your armies, or keep the fleet and lose one of them.  I'm not sure which is more valuable.
