But yeah let\u2019s chat about it after retreats.", "Yeah you\u2019re right just looked at the map holding the build this turn so I can lock up fleet #5 next year seems to be the move", "I feel great about where we\u2019re at.

I\u2019m in Wes, also, which is good as it keeps France from sending Fleets to help England", "So suggestions, after builds are in: Swe S Bal-Den, Bal-Den, Nwy-Nth (guarantees Den succeeds), StP-Bar (making room for that next build).  I think doing a similar risk with Munich might be warranted: Mun-Kie, Ber supports that, Boh S Tri-Trl, Pru-Sil.  Then you likely pick up Kie but lose Munich, but can easily retake Mun in the fall.", "oh wow, nevermind, I didn't realize England already vacated Nth.

With respect to Swe/Den, taking Den with Swe leaves Bal in place, which is great for taking on / protecting Kie/Ber.  However, that also brings up another great use of F Bal: convoys.", "F Bal C Pru-Den, F Swe supports it, and either A Mun-Kie (with support from Ber) or A Ber-Kie (with Boh supporting Mun) ensures that Denmark is captured.  The only counter to that is something I doubt they're clever enough for: Bur + Ruh S Kie-Mun, Hol S Den-Kie - abandon Den in exchange for taking Mun and saving the Danish army by putting it in Kiel.", "If you go with Mun-Kie, then use Boh to support Tri-Trl.  I'll cover Vie again with Bud.", "Our situation with your Vie/Tri centers is tricky: once you recapture Trl, and I'm in Tri, we can press on them, but as long as we need to worry about protecting Vie/Tri from falling into their hands *and* from falling into *my* hands (unintentionally - to keep them out), it'll slow us down, and possibly rob you of the ability to get that last needed northern fleet.", "For now, I'm doing the Bul-Ser-Bud-Vie choo-choo train, as well as taking Adr and moving Gre-Alb.  If you decide to use Boh S Mun, you probably still want Tri-Trl, but that unit may get wrecked by Ven S Trl-Tri.  I'll take back Tri in the fall, and your army there would have been evaporated in that case, but net effect is it won't change your \"available builds\" count, and if you stay even elsewhere, you'll still have another F StP to pull out.", "My southern army is a short term problem that will resolve itself in the next year or so as you (and France potentially?) crush Italy.

Since Tri-Trl is moving unsupported and Italy can counterattack, I definitely need to be ready to crush them in Tri in the fall.  We really didn\u2019t help outlet position with this mildly entangled mess in Austria.  As for you keeping Vienna long term: it is all about moving our alliance forward.  Currently you need the builds, so I got you into Vie and then Tri.  You\u2019re fighting three enemies.  But as you focus on just two, and I come into contact with France, I\u2019ll need the builds just as much, so we\u2019ll just keep track of where we need those builds to come from as we press forward!", "As for moves, it may make sense for me to attack Tri with support now, and if you dislodge, retreat to Vie, which both protects Vie, and allows you to use that to attack Trl.", "So I propose A Bud s Ser-Tri, Ser-Tri, Gre-Alb, Bul-Gre", "Hey Turkey you are totally right and I am absolutely happy to shead those builds to you to help you move the ball forward in the south", "Very good point.", "If I pick up two this turn then I won\u2019t need either center! I just want that northern fleet haha", "Agreed: keeping England on the defensive and keeping all of their armies locked up is key.  The hardest part will be the island and the French home centers.  But once England starts losing centers they\u2019ll crumble.", "What if I just move A Tri - Vie?", "Then you can support me into Thr in the fall?", "Yep that works too", "Makes more sense to me!", "Done.", "The only reason to hit Trl now is to cut any support Trl might give to an attack on Mun.", "Hmmm", "Good point", "In that case hitting Tyr is the superior move. I can still retreat to vie potentially", "Yep that was what I was thinking.", "Lit", "I appreciate running my moves by you. Working with you this game has taught me a lot and made me a stronger player!", "But losing Munich in the spring is not a catastrophe- retreat to Sil, and you already have huge pressure on Kie to ensure you\u2019d get Mun back quickly.

So I\u2019m game to try and out guess them with you, but I think Russia is looking for an ally anywhere.  If you offered an alliance with them (real or fake) they would probably take it.

You go after France, Russia is breathing down your neck.  That\u2019s my main concern: how do I go after Russia if I know France will quickly be taking control of Italy?

So I'm going to guess they're probably saying something similar to russia.", "Are you okay with me moving my fleet into Eng?", "Russia is basically a vassal state of Germany as far as I can tell. Maybe you can try to talk some sense into them? I'm going to plan on moving my fleet into Eng this round, and see how I can support you from there.", "Hey, did you get my messages? I'm not sure if they got through", "No I didn't get any since you talking about germany sweet talking.", "Reposting:\nSure, I had expected you to move it to Eng in Spring tbh\nNow, without Eng to support, it will be hard to take Bel if G makes the right moves.", "I figured since you hadn't said anything you were not thrilled with the idea.  We can always blame our diplomacy overseer for anything going poorly.", "Have you tried talking to russia? I'm wondering if only you had issues sending me messages or if it was a larger issue?", "I have, but I don't think there were issues with the server. They were just busy IRL", "If you didn't have the emoji show up on your messages or didn't click either \ud83d\udc4d or \ud83d\udc4e , just assume it didn't send", "The more I look at the board the more likely it seems T & R are biding their time for R to rebuild and then ally up", "Not that it matters for us currently, we would still have to crush G asap to get the cp we need to defend against that", "So what's next? Will you support me into Bel?", "Yeah I think they're probably going to working together as well. Yeah I'll support you in.", "After I push G out of Bur, I can push for Mun while you go for Kie or Den", "Sounds like a solid plan to me", "Sounds like a solid plan to me", "Alright, so I'll try to get Bel this turn, can I get your support for that?", "Based on Russia's fleet I think I'm going to be having some trouble in the north soon.", "Yeah I saw that", "Thanks for the assist by the way", "Turkey and Russia almost definitely teamed up", "Definitely working together. What's your plan this season? Hold or push further? I'm possibly getting backstabbred by russia and making a push for Den.", "I think Den is good. G will probably disband fleets. You can also just go Nwy-Stp on retreat if you're afraid of the stab there...\nI'll move the line up to munich for a push next year. You can take Kie with my support or Den with your fleet, and I take Mun after.", "There's a small chance you can just do A Hol-Kie, since G needs to cover Ber from R", "Actually, if you could do that, that would guarantee I can move into the Ruhrgebiet", "I can give it a shot", "Are you moving Bel? If not could you support, hol in case Germany tries a push there?.", "I was thinking of using bel to support a move into Ruh", "Can you support A Bur-Ruh? Then I can support a hold in Hol.", "Yes, I just updated to support bur into ruh", "Ok. Will update.", "I negotiated with russia not realizing they were going to easily walk into Austria and Germany. I may have thrown this game, my bad.", "Yeah, R & T position is very strong now.", "Could you move Eng out to NTH? Or elsewhere? I'm moving Bre to Mao and Mao to Wes", "Yeah, I'm moving the up to hopefully contest russia.", "Can you support me moving Nth into Hol? And support Kie if possible? Once I get Hol I think I should be pretty good to hold off Russia from the north.", "I can support Hol but I'm using Ruh to push into Mun, or at least prevent R from doing so.", "support a push into Hol", "Okay. Also turkey reached out to me about attacking russia together, but they wanted to know how I would stop you from taking over the Med. Are you fine with me going for one of your suppy points to make it look like we're fighting?", "After Italy is finished I mean, we can coordinate it so that it just looks like I'm going for it but you can defend it.", "Just something for the future.", "Right, it's possible but there are no convincing moves available at the time so really you could say that you're not in a good position for a stab", "Yeah, I think they want something later on", "Hey, it would've been much more helpful if you had used Kie to attack Ber. Now R has an extra CP for free :/ Should've spotted that as well.", "Imo, if you are doing a hold it needs to be with good reason", "and Den couldn't have been pushed out anyway (you could've also tried moving to Swe, just in case.", "I was expecting russia to make an attack to be honest.", "You making a push on Mun this turn?", "Because I get the feeling I'm about to get wrecked from the north and my best bet is to push through middle with you and cut Russia in half.", "Yes, your support would be appreciated.", "I'm moving in with Ruh", "Done, got me just in time", "Thanks!", "You have any thoughts on moving forward?", "I figure trying to push russia out from the middle while I go from the top? I can try to support you into Mun, but I will probably lose Kie.", "I think it's too late for Mun now", "Bah, adjucation at noon hmm", "Holland is safe for now but R has some crazy navy built up", "Do

Tunesia?", "Tunis is now undefended, and yes, if you were to promise you'd use the build you got from that center to attack England, I'd be ok with you taking that - I'd focus on the two remaining Italian home centers I've got almost surrounded, and would also promise to stop hitting Marseille soo you could bring your Pie army back home to ensure Burgundy is still more safe in case Russia won't help you and keeps attacking Ruh to get to Bur.", "But if Russia is willing to work with you, then yeah, you could get two builds, and you'd be back in this game, as you'd be able to get to Lvp/Lon before Russia could.", "But if you don't feel comfortable with any of that, I'd understand.  You've gotta do what you feel safest doing.  Don't even feel like you need to tell me - I'll do the same either way: Italy has turtled-up pretty good, so it'll take most of my effort just too crack Rom+Nap.  You can ignore Tun or take it - your choice.", "Sounds good. I'll use the Tun build to shore up my defenses with a fleet from Bre.", "Did you come to an arrangement with Russia which ended up feeling safe for you to try?  This game could get to a 12-12-10 three way draw if you can get into position to get Lvp and Lon with builds from Tun and Hol.  I *think* there enough seasons before fall 1910 to get there still...", "we still playing this game? \ud83d\ude42", "Yeah I thought about that", "We'll see what happens with Russia...", "Yep.  I re-read my orders, and I'm crushing Rome and letting you have Tunis to build for the last few game years", "Ok, so where do you need to see my units to give you the breathing room to eliminate England by the end of 1910, so we can have a 3-way draw, instead of 4-way?", "If we can DMZ some area between italy and me then that would free up my fleets", "You are in the more precarious position (although the game is time limited so the danger isn\u2019t quite so great).  So you make a specific proposal and I\u2019ll tell you if that is asking too much or is fine as long as you keep your end of the bargain.", "If you left it up to me, I could say: I\u2019ll park my fleets on Italian coasts and leave TyS empty, but keep Ion for defense", "I normally make very specific proposals, so there's no ambiguity: if you are keeping two fleets in the Med, to protect Tunis, then I can offer to park Tunis on the coast, and do Nap-Tys, Rom-Tys (self bounce) and Ion-Tun (to cut your support so you can't do Tun S Wes-Tys to force Tys from me).  But if you have a different specific suggestion, I'm all ears.", "So what happens with Tys?", "F Tys parks in Tus in this proposal, as that\u2019s the only space available for it that is not occupied", "I guess given your lack of response you don\u2019t like any of my proposals or have any alternative ideas, so I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re *not* going to focus on getting rid of England.  That\u2019s totally reasonable and within your rights, but then that means I have no reason to hold back, I guess.", "I am not attacking you at the moment but I also don't like the proposal.", "So do you have another one?", "I can withdraw from Pie if you withdraw from Tys, but not to Tus.", "I'm not sure how I can make sure you don't attack Tys if I pull back without doing a self-bounce in Tys and Ion-Tun to make sure you don't support an attack on Tys?  If I pull back, and you do Tun S Wes-Tys, you'll get in.", "If Tus makes you uncomfortable, you could *stay* in Pie, as protection?", "That isn't much of protection since it would be easy to get through.", "Tbf, in the long term you could push through anyway. But all I want is some buffer.", "Yeah, I get it.  I guess we could lock down on position a bit: Tys S Ion-Tun, Ion-Tun, Wes S Tun, Tun H, and that way I am not in Tus, and Tunis is locked down safely as well?  I wouldn't be pulling out if Tys in that case.", "I think that's fair. Let's go with that", "Sounds good.  I'll go set my orders before we run out of time.", "Yeah, time limits.", "Sorry about lying about Tus/Lyo, I just had nothing left to do with those.  Couldn't just leave my units waiting around doing nothing.", "So you do realize that both Bel and Hol can get taken this fall, right?  Russia can snap up English centers at their leisure, as England isn't bothering to defend anyways.", "And while you have no reason to trust me, Hol->Bel would mean you only lose one of those two, and since Russia has to do Mun-Ruh too cut Ruh S Hol, so if you counter-attacked: Bur s Ruh-Mun, you could possibly take Munich.", "Seems like you do care about maintaining at least the status quo", "between you and russia that is.", "I can see another way in which I can not got steamrolled. You need to step up and put some pressure on Russia", "I do realize that yes, Russia growing too big too fast is super dangerous for me", "Since you have no reason to trust me, watch what I do.", "And please cover your ass \ud83d\ude42", "Show me some fireworks \ud83e\udde8", "\ud83c\udf86  big enough for you? \ud83c\udf86", "(and did I not tell you about Hol+Bel?)", "(you're welcome ;P )", "You did, but I wasn't willing to make the first stab \ud83d\ude42", "oh that's why I said \"watch I do\" - I figured you had to see it to believe it.", "So, from here, what do you plan to do with Lyo?", "So to be honest, Tunis isn\u2019t something you can safely hold, with England still alive and Russia on your doorstep.  So unless you have a better offer, I\u2019ll be using Lyo to force access to Tunis, since I basically loaned it to you in the first place to get builds to attack England.", "I see, well it's true that England is about to fall", "At least this way you can focus on that direction instead of where it\u2019s a losing battle.", "well that was nice of Russia to give you Munich!", "It's not something I can keep though \ud83d\ude26", "Eh he has a lot of work on my account now.

I'm not sure what France said to sway you. Was it the three initial builds? Cuz you can have Belgium. I'd just really prefer to knock out France. Belgium brest and Portugal can be yours. All I want is Paris and Italy can take Marseilles and Spain. Really we can really negotiate however I'd just rather not be at odds w you. Now I'd figure you'd much rather ally w me seeing as France has struck a deal w every nation I've talked to so far which makes him not that trustworthy and he has three fleets that can easily slip in your back door to my one that you have pinned on land... So if you head my way he's gonna walk in your back door. I would bet you money. What do you say? Can we strike some sort of deal?", "Le me know your thoughts", "I'm sorry mate. France's fleets are too big for me to piss him off. I won't push past Denmark, and if you can negotiate peace with him I'll respect it", "Alright. Understood", "I mean honestly mate he's gonna attack you either way. And the two of us can stop him... I'm not sure why you'd back off like that. I don't mean to be rude but how much experience do you have with this game?", "I'm saying honestly both cuz it's by far the most logical thing to do and he's in great position to do it now that he's advanced and you've completely backed off and cuz it's literally what he told me he was going to do", "What makes you say we can push him back if he has deals with everyone?", "If you surrender Denmark to me, I will help you survive France's push. I am not going to involve myself in this war for either side without immediately tangible benefits. France is a difficult invasion for me, and I've spent a lot of time in the North Sea with no new land.", "He doesn't have actual deals. Not ones people are intending to follow through on cuz they don't trust him cuz he makes deals w everyone. Russia doesn't trust him and is way too busy w Austria and turkey. Italy doesn't trust him either and I convinced him to invade the south although he's kind of a mess at the moment. I actually don't know if turkey or Austria has any sort of deal with france. And who is actually free to intervene against us?", "I'm not sure how you can make tangible benefits if you don't involve yourself though honestly. And if you help me out we'll topple France and how can I come attack you? Honestly. France is headed for you as we speak and is trying to sue for peace with me so that he can complete his invasion of you. Not to mention he has three fleets you just turned your back on. Please, listen to reason here. Either way, I'd much rather you take Belgium. Can we make that deal?", "Sorry about the delay. I'm willing to exchange Belgium for cooperation against France.", "Alright sounds good", "How should I move? I don't know how to handle his fleets", "Well moving out of the channel seriously set you back", "But we can fix this", "If you move to the north Atlantic, English Channel and North sea and your army to Wales you can cover your back side and set up a convoy route into France", "How's that sound", "I am not gonna go Nor Atl bcause I want a fleet in Nor, but the rest sounds good. France wants to move into Picardy this turn", "Also given how weird the western triangle has been, can I ask what you're going to do with your fleet? turning to face france leaves me vulnerable in

{"messages": ["I'm hoping we can come to a few agreements. Burgundy is a trouble spot for us both. Could we dmz it? I think at the worst, non agression would be in both our best interests, but I'd definitely be open to any proposition you've got", "Sorry for the brief message- I'll be available for more negotiation later today. I currently want to support Paris to Burgundy since I am not sure what everyone's plans are yet, and if it looks like we are in good position to work together in the fall I can use Burgundy to take Belgium.", "No worries. Alright. I understand the move to burgundy but I think it should be obvious that any move into my territory would be met with aggression. Update me in the fall of your intentions?", "Thanks. Yeah, it's not that I don't trust you to DMZ Burgundy, but I can't think of a reason not to make the move honestly since it completely protects me against both you and Italy and still leaves room for us to work together. In that sense it leaves me some flexibility to decide my intentions in the fall- the truth is that I currently have no intentions and will let my targets pick themselves.", "What are your plans in terms of your moves?", "It looks like we've already got ourselves a rat. I've heard rumors of Britain looking to attack me. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm sure he's roped you in too. While, on the flipside he keeps trying to convince me to attack you alongside him. I think he wants to pit us against each other and use the opportunity to swoop against either or both of us. I think we should knock him out while we have the opportunity", "Yeah, I think you could be right about this. What would this look like? Do you think England will end up taking the Channel?", "Has he contacted you? And I'm not sure. I don't think he'd be that aggressive right from the start. I can't say I know for sure. What do you want to do?", "England did contact me. I might be inclined to take the channel if Russia went to St Petersburg with an army, but at the moment I think it is better to wait and see", "(wait and see in terms of how to attack England)", "Nice opening moves. Are you going for Belgium? I was planning to head there from Burgundy but it looks like you are in a position to support yourself in anyway.", "Yeah. Like I said seems England wouldn't be so thoroughly aggressive for a first move. But we should keep an eye out you're right", "Thank you. Yeah I'd like to take Belgium. I hope there's no issue with that", "I am concerned over you getting 3 builds and would be a lot more comfortable with that arrangement if you build 2 fleets", "To be honest I haven't thought about builds. I'll build completely contingent on how everyone around me is postured. If you're not in position and russias not in a position to attack me considering two fleets is a lot more viable", "Now why would you do that my friend? Bad mistake", "I know it is an aggressive move, and I wanted to tell you about it but I couldn't risk not getting the additional build to put down 2 fleets and attack England", "I will be withdrawing from Munich immediately if you are willing to help with the assualt- I know what this looks like but I promise you will absolutely love my builds", "One more point. England proposed a plan to bounce you out of Denmark (but I knew he was lying about it)", "See you could've gotten those two fleet builds with Portugal and Spain. You don't need the army in Paris unless you want to attack me. If you don't build your army in Paris and only build the fleets, we'll be fine. If you build the army in Paris it's going to mean war", "I can do that for sure, though it does mean slowing down potential convoys into England. What does this look like more broadly? Would you be willing to build a fleet in Kiel to take the North Sea? Does this mean you are letting me keep Munich so I can build a fourth fleet next turn?", "Also, we can get creative with my unit in Munich by sending it to Tyrolia to attack and/or help Austria", "I want to make this work to the point of potentially waiving a build, so I hope we can figure this out. Completely realistically speaking, I think EG struggles to take out F, and EF or FG has a much easier time just considering the distribution of builds. That's really important in a game that ends in 1910", "Another consideration is that England seems like the type of person to switch sides at a moment's notice, and there are some concerns regarding whether they can write orders without a misorder (given their turn 1 misorder)", "I think that The best way to do that is for you to build F Kiel and A Berlin, which I realize is a tough sell, but if we do that we can have 5 fleets on England's 3 and quickly roll over him", "No response?", "I couldn't waive a build without hearing anything back from you", "It was written and I then changed my orders", "Yeah sorry thought I responded", "I can't really do a fleet build", "You understand", "I think we could work together but I definitely need you out of Munich and back to burgundy and then out of burgundy from there", "So let's work something out. What's the game plan?", "Why do you seem so determined to go after me? I have you at a stalemate that only England can break meaning he'll reap the rewards and Italy and England are both poorly defended. I honestly just want to know the strategic motivation behind it. Legitimate question. I'm curious what you see that I don't...", "I'll send Brest to English Channel and MAO to Irish Sea, but I need Belgium so that I don't go down a build.", "In regards to your question, wouldn't you agree that it is not me, but you who are committed towards attacking me? You built two armies and tried to take Picardy. Not saying we can't recover from that- but you left yourself no option to attack or defend against England. Whereas my 2 fleet builds can be used against England and are in position to do so.", "Cuz you did what I thought you were gonna do. I don't want you taking Belgium and I need you out of ruhr which is one of the places I thought you'd go and is kinda an aggressive move. Now I'm not super interested in giving up Belgium to be honest but I'm not an unreasonable man. Let's negotiate.", "At the end of the day I need a dot, whether that's Munich or Belgium or something else. In return I'd push fleets into Irish, English, and MAO, which sets up a convoy into Wales. And I might try to persuade Russia to help you keep Denmark.", "On your end you should probably take the Helgoland Blight while you still can. That will make it especially hard for England to keep attacking you", "If the English fleet gets into Denmark and you aren't in the Helgoland, it becomes super easy for England to support themselves into hel and then convoy to Kiel,Holland,Belgium, etc.", "But if you are in the Helgoland all of a sudden they have to support Denmark to hol", "\"hold", "Alright I'll think about the move set and get back to you in the morning", "I don't see why you need a dot", "Just disband the troop in ruhr. That would have us certainly on peaceful terms", "Because you're asking me to use 3 fleets, 1 army (for a convoy), and lose a unit to attack England. When you've been super aggressive towards me with your builds and moves. I'm not going to attack England if you aren't willing to make any consessions.", "OK I understand what you're saying. I'll think of something amicable for us both when I wake up fr", "Did you think of anything? Just curious.", "Oh sorry. I've been real busy", "Hold on", "I mean. One thought is to have me take Belgium this year and for me to give it to you back next year. That way you can build a fleet and I would be out of Ruhr as well (Ruhr to Belgium). And I'd use Belgium to convoy out", "You still there?", "Sorry", "Yes", "No need to apologise. I get that you are busy for labor day weekend. Just know that I need a real response before the deadline is over if you are serious about actually working things out. I'll be around for the entire rest of the day.", "I think that should be agreeable. Let me look at the map again", "Seems like you've lost interest in this game? I'd be upset if you weren't talking to me.

I'd love for us to stop all the infighting and make an efg happen", "That's what I wanted from the getgo", "Juggernauts coming though and regardless of if you are got buffer or not if you let that buffer go down in me and England it'll steam roll you just the same", "I'm thinking you want to move to Tyrolia and support Ruhr to Munich while I swing my fleets back south", "Ouch, England got you good.", "I can help you", "You still around? If you don't make a very specific move you will lose 4 supply centers this year. No matter what, you will be losing at least 2 supply centers. It's up to you how much you actually want to stay in the game.", "How would like to work together though?", "Hold on and I'll respond more in full", "Yeah I'm still here", "Well, I'm not actually sure what the orders are going to end up being, but what I can tell you are my current moves so that it can help you plan your defense. I'm moving to Ruhr and supporting myself to Belgium (no use in lying about that). So Ruhr's support, whatever it is, will be cut.", "I think it is safe to assume that Munich and Holland supports will also be cut", "So my recommendation to you if you want to stay in the game would be to use Berlin to support Ruhr to Kiel.", "I tell you this with little risk since if you tell England, he'll simply change the plan to one without this key vulnerability", "Now, you have reason to mistrust me, but the truth is that I have 3 fleets and only 2 armies. I stand to gain the least from continuing to attack you. And my largest concern is a Turkey/Russia or Austria/Turkey alliance, which is where I plan to put my focus. I intend to let England and Russia squabble over your supply centers while I move fleets south to help out Italy", "And with Russia taking Munich, your survival means that we could coordinate to take it back in the case of a Russia/Turkey alliance.", "So it looks like you really have given up", "I know things are looking bleak, but if you are willing to entertain me for a bit I have a plan that

How do you feel about moving against Russia, as I believe that he will be the biggest threat to the two of us. He is really posturing in his communications with me", "Sure, that makes sense. Like I said, first thing would be  to keep Russia out of RUM, whether that be by supporting yours or my army in.  Italy is pretty quiet but what I did hear from him was fairly anti Austrian by the way. I believe they are probably pretty tight with Russia, them being natural allies anyway.", "Well I'm getting the same sort of stuff from Russia that you have. They are indicating to me that they will commit south and want to attack you directly with my help. I have told them I'd consider it but know that I am firmly locked in to working together with you. Looks like our neighbours have made the decision for us really which makes it easy right?", "I'm quite happy to support you going into Romania as I can imagine that I'll need my forces to fend off Italy. Will you be moving up to Bulgaria this turn and go onto Romania from there?", "Ok yes let's do that and I can support you into Greece the following year if you don't get it this year.", "Just confirming that you will support my BUL army into Rum this season?

I reckon we've got Russia on the backfoot now", "Yes, nice one. I'm glad we could sort things out. Next is to get you into Greece then we'll have secured our front and can go from there. Russia does have three on RUM but we can fend that off together and Warsaw for you and Moscow for me can be the mid-term goal. What do you think?", "Sounds like a plan. I'll support Rum this turn and move down into Greece", "Ah, I didn't see that Italy was in Greece. Would have been wise to check the map before sending messages", "Haha yeah well we can knock him out of there if you like, either in the spring or fall, he can't stop it since he built that fleet in rom...", "What do you want me to do in regards to Russia?", "We can support your bud army into gal. I think that would be best. So I support you into gal and support ser army into Greece. If it works out for spring I mught be able to get a convoy in in fall but that's probably a next year thing.", "Yeah okay, that works", "Hmm we might need to change our plans. I think Russia is planning to go to sil anyway. Still on for Greece though. What are you going to do about tri? Can you trust Italy not to go for it?", "Yeah i think best to support you into Greece in the fall. Just need to hold in rum this season. If you can still support me in rum that would be appreciated.", "Roger that", "I'm not sure if going for Greece this turn is entirely preferable as Italy said they plan to move out and it might be better not to provoke them quite yet", "Ok good call", "Well looks like Italy messed it up. Anyway thanks for the support. Looks like I did need it after all. What do you want to do this season?", "Now Italy has moved into Tyr, which we agreed was a DMZ so if you could support Ser in Greece that'd be much appreciated. What do you want to do Vis a vis Russia?", "No problem, I will support you into Greece. If you can attack gal to cut the support there and support me in rum that would be great. All going well we get one each. Do you think Italy will be getting out of Greece though anyway?", "Actually don't worry about supporting in rum, just the hit on gal should do it.", "Just confirming that you still need my support into Greece? And can still hit gal for me?", "Yes for both", "Italy claims to be moving out of Greece. I might need to pull the support. I'm being told that you and Russia might be attacking me instead \ud83d\ude1f", "Meh I'll trust you over them. Ill keep the support locked in. If you and Russia wanted to take rum you could do it. Then we would be bogged down for the foreseeable future and that would just help the West. We have the jump on the west at this point so I'll hope you're still on board for that reason.", "Russia and I haven't been in contact since I first betrayed him. May I ask who told you this?", "Italy was suggesting it more than saying it but they got me a bit paranoid anyway", "Now there's something. Italy was suggesting that he and I go against you", "Yeah I'm not surprised. He was also offering me support into Serbia. We can stick to our guns here and easily take Russia and Italy. Ive got the paranoia in check now.", "Aye, Russia was also asking me to turn on you but we've got a good thing going here", "Russia has asked me to work with him and Italy (don't know for sure that they are in cahoots yet), and suggested that he support me into Romania and Italy into Bulgaria. This is of course, not possible now that Italy had retreated from Greece.\n\nI was wondering perhaps if I should string Russia along, so that we may know his moves?", "You could definitely do that if you like. We will know more once we see where Russia builds", "I suspect Italy and Russia would be working together at least at some level. They are obvious allies. We have the jump on both of them now though", "So I was thinking I would push into UKR this year and then MOS. Depending on how things go, I can support you into WAR and go for MOS next year. IF you can support my RUM army to UKR and Russia covers WAR then the UKR army will have to disband. Also you can perhaps take the ADR? If you get it, we can get ION in the fall. What do you think?", "Done and done. Supporting RUM - UKR, Disrupting BOH and hopefully taking ADR", "What do you want to do for this one? We should probably repeat our fleet moves. This time we would get one or the other", "If you can disrupt UKR, I'll stop BOH and see if Germany could hit SIL and then I'll move GAL into WAR, which will deprive Russia of a build", "Ok have locked that in", "Might need to shift tack a little bit. Would love to break through into Russia but maybe we need to make ground into Italy first?", "Aye, we seem to be in a bit of a stalemate at the moment", "Ill come in to the ADR so don't go there with your fleet. Also I will support your army in GAL to UKR - that might get us somewhere. But I guess we will have a new army in WAR to worry about. Will check again after the builds.", "It wont be worth it. You just get to be the second target for Russia and Italy. If you want to turn it around, let me know", "Although since Germany has given gifts to everyone and England has essentially stopped playing this game has deteriorated into pointless territory", "It has gotten rather back and forth", "Well you've given up your best ally for... well... nothing? Are you going to follow through as Russia's Puppet?", "Honestly, at this point I don't even know. Fancied a little shake up as the game was getting a bit stale", "Yeah I get that. If you can convince Russia to worry about the main threat - France. Call a truce and you and I can both try and hold France back. If not, I will obviously just help France take it out for the price of my survival. I don't really mind either way", "Will see what Russia has to say", "Russia should be moving to Boh and Sil, you and I should get into ION and TYS, knock Italy out because why not. However, if Russia doesn't move his armies west to Boh and SIL or he moves MOS to UKR, it will be pretty obvious that he's just going to take you out.", "I do reckon he'll try to come after me after I betrayed him at the start", "If you want, I can support you into SEV.

Is it like he is not responding to you, or he flat out refused?", "Because it is possible that he has been MIA for the past few days", "Any Intel on England or Germany?", "England is worried about being caught in the middle of you and Germany. And Germany is just happy that we've tied up Russia", "Cool- makes sense. It has been very quiet lately, which is concerning me greatly.", "I think that's just because it's the weekend. I imagine it'll pick back up once orders start going through", "Russia was not responding due to the weekend and he said he would be extremely enthusiastic to work with you.", "Looks like you are in good shape. I'd watch out in case Turkey intends to stab you for 2 (Serbia and Greece)", "So. What are your thoughts on this game right now?", "Are you attacking Italy?", "I love to see you working with Russia against Turkey. I'm assuming a retreat to Ukraine with the idea of taking Rumania?", "By the way, what is your plan with the Adriatic Sea? Will you be fighting Italy?", "That was mainly to stop Turkey getting a foothold there", "It might work in our favor actually if the plan is to dislodge Turkey from the Ionian- we have a total of 4 fleets to his 3.", "Looks like:\nUkraine-Rumania\nMoscow S Sevastopol H\nBudapest S Serbia H\nSerbia S Ukraine-Rumania\nGalicia S Ukraine-Rumania\n\nwill guarantee you Rumania", "What is your relationship with Italy like? I thought you two were fighting by bouncing in the Adriatic so much \ud83d\ude05", "I'm happy to help the cause and I've told Italy my moves each turn, but I still feel like I don't know what the plan is here. (Is there even a plan?)", "Thoughts on moves?", "This game is going very well for you. You have zero threats and allies all around you. You are highly likely to take Bulgaria and/or Greece this year", "We should talk about borders- if you can move your fleet from the Adriatic to Albania it would help you capture Greece, and I'd have no problems staying out of Tyrolia and Trieste if you are willing to do the same.", "Thoughts?", "Not sure why Italy disbanded Ionian, but I figure he may have missed the deadline for builds", "We need to move quickly if we still want to get the edge on Turkey", "Also, any thoughts on Russia?", "I'm fine with keeping out of Tyr and Tri to maintain a dmz between us\n\nI'm not 100% sure about Russia at the moment, I feel as though as soon as Turkey is gone he will move against me", "Sounds good. I agree, I would definitely not leave yourself open to being stabbedd by Russia if possible", "It looks like you are aiming to take Venice? Meanwhile, Turkey has a walk into Tunis and will only get stronger. Maybe we should try to cooperate instead of fight?", "What gives with the move to Trieste?", "Ngl, completely forgot about it being a dmz. I'm not attacking you dw", "Ok- I can trust that since I think taking the Ionian and/or Albania is a priority for you", "Damn- I seriously did not intend to take Trieste. I had figured I would want to stay in Venice for the time being with you bordering it with two units and didn't think I would actually end up there", "If there is absolutely anything I can do to help you with my army in Trieste, it's your unit to order", "I guess just pull back to Venice?", "Sure- especially if Italy keeps Piedmont, that might be the move. I am also happy to help support Budapest to hold so that you don't lose it to Russia. Speaking of which, I am assuming you are disbanding the Adriatic Sea? It doesn't seem to be very useful since Turkey will be able to keep it out of the Ionian anyway.", "Any more thoughts now that builds have been put down?", "If you can support a hold in Budapest, could I take Venice for the time being? I'm getting rather weak as it goes", "I feel like you should have kept Albania instead of Adriatic. Putting the fleet in Venice only moves us backwards", "I can't stop you from moving to Venice though I do feel like you are better off putting it on the front lines", "Disbanding Albania was a mistake, I'll admit", "I was assuming a move like that meant you might be working with Turkey again, which would probably be a huge help for you", "Darn, we weren't on the same page last turn, but I'm super glad to see you work with Turkey again", "Russia is in a really good position to wipe you off the map so I would definitely try to slow him down. I'll do what I can in the North", "Just as a sidenote, I noticed you held in Budapest, but it could have potentially supported Serbia to Rumania.", "Sorry, the bot was down for a short bit. If you support Budapest to hold with Serbia and Turkey cuts Rumania, you'll keep Budapest: otherwise you probably will lose it to Russia", "Congrats on keeping Budapest!", "We can definitely keep pushing back Russia", "Turkey and Russia both told me that they want to eliminate you and England and go for a 3 way draw", "I'm not sure I'm very interested in that because we only just started making progress against Russia, and Russia/Turkey alliance is always scary and may be able to overpower me in the long run (they don't want to give me any of the builds)", "Would you be willing to support Tunis to the Ionian Sea in the Spring? Also, I can give you Trieste in the fall in exchange for Vienna if that's alright with you.", "Oh crap, you have a disband", "Not sure what the best disband is. Probably either Budapest or Adriatic", "I think:\nBudapest-Rumania\nSerbia S Budapest-Rumania\n\n Gives you the highest chances of surviving from Russia/Turkey onslaught this turn", "And actually, Serbia-Albania would ensure Turkey cannot outflank us", "Darn, if you had moved Budapest to Rumania you would have kept Serbia \ud83d\ude29.

{"messages": ["Hello Russia, I am curious as to whether or not you would be content to split Scandinavia equally between yourself, Germany, and me. Does that prospect interest you?", "Hi england! I'm assumimg that you're planning on heading to Nwy, and Germany would go to Denmark. If we could share that would be great! I would preffer if you went there with a fleet instead of a unit. I would be willing to give you unaposed access to Nwy if you agree to this (I won't move Mos-Stp, then Stp-Nor for a stand-off). Looking forwards to a great game with you!\n-Russia", "Hey! That appears to be how things are going. I'll move my fleet into Nwy and we can have a grand ole time. Cheers and good luck!", "You too!", "Hey. Whats up with that anti - Russian start?", "Apologies. Not trying to counter you. I'll be taking Norway like I said but, and the other fleet is to pressure Benelux", "Ok. that's fair. It is a pretty typical opening now that  I think about it. As long as you don't convoy your army across, we should be good/", "Thx for sharing! Good luck over there in the west!", "My dearest Russia", "I have a weird request", "We share an Iberian ally, and that ally would love it if we took denmark this turn. Would you be willing to support SKA into denmark next turn? My Norway fleet will be heading south.", "Rather took denmark next turn*", "Ummm... ok?", "Lol I know it's weird. You can talk to France to verify", "Alright just a reminder to support Ska into Denmark so I don't bounce. I'm moving one of my fleets into Nor just because its not good form to leave an undefended supply center, but the denmark fleet will move west soon so we'll be back to one fleet each in the region", "I'm a bit confused here. I'm willing to help you take Denmark, but I am going to need something in return. I love the alliance between you me and France, but taking Denmark doesn't really benefit anybody but you. I would be willing to support you into Denmark, if  you move your fleet in the Norwegian west. I really don't like the look of all three of your fleets hovering over Scandinavia. If I support you into Denmark, and you move your fleet west, we will both have one troop in that area.", "Alright. That works for me.", "Is NWG to Edi good enough for you?", "Yea, sure. Thanks for cooperating", "Awesome no problem.", "Wait up. I'm assuming I'm supporting Ska into Denmark?", "I'm thinking of moving to Sil. If you could move into Hel, me, you, and franc could crush germany", "Correct on supporting Ska.", "I think our alliance with France has great potential.", "and north to Helgoland?", "And I'm bouncing North Sea in EC but I am down to move there next turn", "Also I agree with our triple alliance. That will be very helpful for everyone", "Why would you bounce? Hel is a much more powerful postition", "I'm not exactly sure but France proposed it and I'm rolling with the flow", "?", "Sorry. I really am. I hope our alliance can maybe continue?? I was talking with France and a ton of the stuff didn't match up, and I was worried you would attack me. I should have let you know, as it is clear you only told the truth.", "What didn't match up?", "Stuff like the bounce in English Channel", "But what if I move out of Norway and let you get it back. Could that  save our alliance?", "Ok, I need to go now, but we can talk in the morning?>", "Yeah let's talk then.", "Hello. If you leave Nor this turn our alliance will survive for the time being.", "Again, sorry for the stab. In hindsight, I can't really say it was a mistake. Even though I feel bad I REALLY needed the build as Austria and Turkey are running a relentless attack against me. I appreciate you're cooperation. I fear if we go to war, I will be pressured from all sides and will be eliminated. But, that would probably also end the alliance with you and France, and they are looking in a much better position then you right now. So I would really like to continue our alliance. I will move out of Nwy this turn, provided you don't take Sweden.", "If I have Norway and Denmark I am content.", "Lovely. I have been talking to france, and in the interest of keeping you strong to fight Austria and Turkey, I surrender any german centers except Denmark to you", "I don't blame you for stabbing me, because it's reasonable to play aggressively if you think you're cornered. That said, my movements last turn ought to indicate that you're not cornered, so I am hoping we can return to normal relations. I am interested in the current FER alliance to counter AT and would prefer it survives.", "Actually, I just looked at the map again. You can keep Nor for now.", "I'd rather you fight AT in the East rn, and it looks like you do need every single center you can get.

Go show those silly south-eastern nations who's boss lmao", "I love the spirit!", "Is it ok with you if I move into Scandinavia>", "What tile specifically?", "Lol. I meant SKA", "I really hope you don't stab me. It would probably mean the end of both our nations.", "Nevermind. I won't move into Ska. Wouldn't be a good move anyways. Ideally I would move into Nth and you would move NTH to helgoland, where we could both attack Germany but I realize that you might not trust me enough to do that.", "I'm moving Edi into NTH, and NTH into helgo", "I won't stab you. If you're peaceful from here on out I'm chill to be peaceful like I have been", "Ok. Are you ok with me moving to nth?", "I will be peaceful. Would be in my best interests not to be anyways", "By nth you mean North Sea right? If so don't move there. My Edi Fleet is going into North Sea", "To support south", "Yes, that's what I mean", "Won't move there then", "Want me to support you from Edi to NTH?", "nothing else for my fleet to do", "Sure", "Here's a tentative plan for the fall: \nKiel-Berlin \nBohemia-Munich \nSilesia S Bohemia-Munich\n Burgundy-Ruhr\n English Channel S Picardy-Belgium\n Picardy-Belgium \nHelgoland-Holland \nNorth Sea S Helgoland-Holland", "Enlands idea above", "Alright thanks", "So I have a very weird proposition for you. What are your thoughts on me convoying an army into Livonia to help support you defending centers? I figure that France will hold the Med, so it's up to you and me to hold and push in the east.", "Idk... that seems like a very precarious position for me to be in if your army is in Livonia.... and although I would like this alliance to last a long time, we can't really know when/if our alliance will end and when it does if you have an army in liv...", "while I appreciate the offer I just don't think I can trust you with basically the fate of my country depending if you stab me or not", "also just some intel I think Italy is a really bad player...", "So what do you think about the future of this alliance? What happens when/if we are both large superpowers?", "That's fair on the Livonia idea lol. It sounded interesting but I'd probably decline too.", "What makes you say that about Italy?", "And I am 1000% down to draw this out with FER, but if I get stabbed obviously I'm going to make it my life goal to be insanely inconvenient.", "Hi. Can Kiel support Munich to Berlin? I would really appreciate it and would support you into a territory sometime", "Sounds good homeslice", "Sweet! I'm just wondering about all your troops... where are they going to go? I feel like to only people you are in a good position to attack is me and France, which makes this sort of awkward \ud83d\ude43", "Lmao I've been talking to France about that. Going to convoy to Italy and see the world a bit", "Stabbing either you or France would get me right solidly dead so I'm not looking to start a right", "Lol how are you going to convoy to Italy???", "I believe you it's just you don't have enough fleets to get there. Trust me, I like this alliance too.", "Just trying to figure out my plans", "I know it sounds dumb \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 France wants me to convoy via my and his fleets", "Let me find what move he said he wanted hold up", "He said he can move to EC and MAO to convoy me into North Africa", "Lol ok", "Alright how do you wanna split up Germany?", "Btw France doesn't want me to convoy anymore so I'm not sure what exactly the move is.", "Ig u get Kiel and holland and I get Ber and Mun?", "Sounds good to me", "Hey sorry about Berlin. France told me you reneged on something about Munich and I didn't want to piss them off. Hopefully we're still chill", "It's ok. Were good. Any plans for the next turn? You having 3 troops stuck in england really sucks...", "Yeah it blows lol. I guess I'm just gonna sit around. On the bright side side, even if I pushed out of mainland Europe I can just chill", "Here's hoping France decides it's time to do something", "Hey partner. Is there a way to resolve our current disagreements without violence?", "Hey. I'm surrendering Kiel to you.", "Hi england; sorry I havn't gotten back to you. I'm really sorry I did that, and I feel kinda bad since I really like you as a player. You were in a really tough predicament there, with all you're troop builds, and nowhere to put them. And as much as would have loved to continue our alliance, you can see how tricky the predicament was. If the situation allows, I would be totally open to something in the future.", "Good luck!", "Thanks!", "So out of curiosity... are you gonna try to take my home centers or can I just ride this one out?", "Looks like france got me", "Lol it's kind of looking like that", "yep", "If you can survive  a few more years youll be in the draw", "who knows", "anything is possible", "That's what I'm hoping for\ud83d\ude02I knew I wasn't good enough to win so I just wanted to hang out until the draw lmao", "yea", "But I'm pretty confident I'll make it to 1910 and might be able to get a three way with france and turkey (sorry)", "No need to apologize my man I respect the hustle. I hope you make it.", "Thanks. I hope u do too", "Loved our alliance while it lasted btw", "If you move Edi to North, and I support myself in norway, then france won't be able to take norway, and they will have one less center", "Hey... could I ask a small favor of you?", "It's basically a lost fight but I'm not going to give up", "England can you do that please?", "Hello comrade sorry about the delay class has been hectic. I'm down to go out in a blaze of glory I'll help you out", "lol thanks \ud83e\udd73", "Techically this if you were 100% self interested this would be gud for u 2 since france winning would mean there isn't a draw which you could be in \ud83d\ude24", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Damn that was stupid of u", "Oh well.

{"messages": ["Greetings from the South! Hope you are doing well! Wondering if we might be able to build a good relationship. Do you prefer to bounce in the black sea?", "Hey just replying to your message on backstabbr, happy to work together. So will you go to gal and ukr? I think we should still bounce in the black sea as it won't be great to make it obvious that we are working together...", "Hi Turkey! I would love to have a good relationship between our two great countries! Are you up for blitzing Austria? Looking forwards to a great game with you! \n-Russia", "I think we should leave the Black Sea as a DMZ, as I would like to 100% ensure I get Rum and I'm worried about Austria taking it. So if we can agree to leave it as a DMZ I can move my fleet to rum", "Hmm ok that sounds fine,makes sense. As long as you're willing to help me take bud within the next couple of years and I'll return the favour for vie. What's your read on Italy in all of this?", "He says that he and Austria have reached a truce for tyr", "Hey so I ended up going to the black sea defensively because of all the info I was getting from Austria that you were planning to attack me. Not sure whether you actually are or whether you had the same sort of information from them that I was planning against you. I'm hoping its the latter as we have a great opportunity to carve up Austria given their very passive start. They should only get one build so they will be behind.", "Austria was telling me that you were going to attack me", "Wait what?!?!", "Austria is telling you imma attack you?", "I agree w/ the great opportunity to get them", "Alright, well that just isn't true. I guess they want to try and keep us from becoming allies. How about this - you take Rum with support and I take the Black Sea. I get BLA for insurance and you get Rum which gives you an extra build. I will try for Greece and might get it then we will be set up to attack Austria", "To be honest, I don't really want you to have BLA. I'm just not there yet (although probably will be eventually). So what if I move to rum supporting myself, and you can attempt to trick Austria to support you into gre.", "The ideal would be if I moved into Gal this turn, which would put tremendous pressure on Austria. But this would only work if my fleet moved too Rum, and you supported it.", "If your working with Austria and betraying me I swear...", "Your basically for sure my ally now. Early in the game I was debating an alliance with Austria, but they seem to be spreading a lot of misinformation, and are asking for very unreasonable things. I think they still think I'm allied with them, so maybe I could persuade them not to move into rum and then you wouldn't even have to support me? If that worked it would be amazing as we would each get a build (I would actually get two).", "I'm spreading some rumors about me being allied with Austria, hoping the news get back to them so don't be alarmed if somebody says something about that to u", "OK I understand your hesitancy over BLA. Yes, Austria is spreading a lot of misinformation, to Italy as well as us. There are three things here and I can only give up one otherwise I'm putting myself under way too much risk. Its either 1) you taking RUM by yourself and I wont try and stop it 2) black sea DMZ (but we'd need to bounce it) 3) me supporting you into Rum. Whichever one you take, I can't give up any of the others. I would be too far onto the back foot with you getting a freebe in the North and Austria seemingly coming for me. 1902 will be a big year and if we work this out and we play it as allies then we can both have a lot of trust going into next year which will  be really valuable.", "I would really like a lot of trust between us, as our alliance can be insanely powerful. I'm going to take Rum, and PLEASE don't stop me. But you don't need to support me either. I don't see why you would want BLA if not  too attack me?", "Oh man", "Well played Ig.", "\ud83d\ude2d", "Ah very difficult to work out what was going to happen there after the first season. I knew I had to at least not give up the Black sea as that would be terrible for me. I had to protect it. It doesn't mean we have to be in all out war though. I just got too paranoid I guess.", "Mhm.", "Right", "obviously I can totally trust you, right?", "I'm willing to be allies with you", "But I just can't believe that you were \"protecting yourself\" by moving to the black see. And as for your message before, 1 and 2 are just normal things that we would do in an alliance, those don't harm you at all.\" 1) you taking RUM by yourself and I wont try and stop it 2) black sea DMZ (but we'd need to bounce it) 3) me supporting you into Rum. \"", "ok. So how about I won't attack you in Rum, if you don't attack me in gal. does that sound fair?", "That sounds fair to me.", "Oh it seems I didn't send that message off. I guess that's why you went ahead and attacked me in rum", "I think a move into Eas could have a lot of potential.", "For me?", "Oops. I meant Greece. So ig ur going to attack me in Sev. Last chance to crush Austria?", "Ok yes let's do it. I think they are after me anyway", "I'll support you into bud", "Great. I will support you into Sur next turn then", "lol turkey", "I did not have enough time to change my orders. Plus I didn't know which army to support... We needed more time.", "Ok. Try again next turn", "I think I will move Moscow into War, with Sil supporting, where I could go for Austria the following turn.", "Also I will move Ukraine to gal. Could you support me there?", "This is where we need to trust each other. I will be leaving Mos undefended and I need you not to stab me", "Sorry, got all this way too late. I really have no idea whether you're actually willing to work with me or not at this point but I am open to ideas.", "I would like to work with you. I realize that you and Austria have an alliance against me, but so far you guys haven't done that much(although I will admit you have me anoyed \ud83d\ude24). Right now, you could lie to me, tell Austria your plans, and stab me, but I think that the better option for both of us is to work together against Austria. It seems like they totally trust you, and have left many territories undefended. Currently me and Italy have an alliance, and together the 3 of us could rip through Austrias territory, as they aren't expecting it", "If you are up for this, I think the ideal attack would be:\nAeg - Gre\nIon s Aeg - Gre\nRum - Ser\nBul s Rum - Ser\nCon - Bul\nSev - Rum", "This would garuntee you two of Austria supply centers, unless Austria does something very weird.  I could support myself into Gal, and attempt to move for Vie.", "So, what do you think? Up for leaving you Austrian ally behind and siding with me? Our alliance, if it works, could be a monumental one", "You still around?", "Im up for this if you can confirm - so you want to take back Sev though right?", "And is Italy on board?", "Italy is on board.", "I would like to have sev back, yes. I would be willing to give you support sometime in a future turn if you let me have sev back.", "I would almost think that you are controlling Austria and turkey", "Your absolutely ridiculous.", "You have such a good chance to stab Austria, and your practically doing nothing against me.", "And I think I have lost count of how many times you have stabbed me", "I was honestly ready this time. I thought we had more time. I needed more time to sort it out with Italy. I see they didn't support me so luckily I didn't get the moves changed.", "Mhm", "You\u2019ve only said that, oh, how many times?", "If I don't hear from you, then lets leave this until next year. I need confirmation otherwise its too risky.", "I told you I needed confirmation otherwise it was too risky. I didn't get confirmation from Italy and there you go, too risky wouldn't have worked.", "And you tell me Italy is on board and next minute they are asking me to support them into Greece", "Ok fine. You didn't really do any damage to me anyways", "But now we have the whole weekend to work this out.", "And ultimatly, I don't really care anymore what you do'", "but if you attack me again I won't be up for negation anymore", "OK but I can't give up SEV, not yet anyway. Way too dangerous. Move into GAL and I'll support you into BUD in the fall", "You're funny. Why is giving up Sev \"way too dangerous? It's not like me having it gives me access to very much of your territory... it is Russian territory after all. You are already a very powerful country, and if you do as I suggest, moving into Gre and Serbia, you could have nine supply centers. If you give me Sev, I will support you into Bud", "So I think the ideal would be something like:\nIon - Gre\nAeg s Ion - Gre\nRum - Ser\nBul s Rum - ser\nSev - Rum", "Sev is too dangerous because Sev to Arm together with your ally Italy by sea and its basically and I just lost Austria as an ally. In the short-term then you have 3 to attack RUM with. Also, you think I can hold off you, Italy and Austria at the same time? I don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as you're suggesting. Also, why would I be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally Italy to come back at me by sea. And I don't know where you get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then you're really going to support me into RUM in the fall *as well* as the 2 I got from Austria? So you get 1 and I get 3, that's really the deal you're happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but we both know you have no intention of supporting me into RUM in the Fall. You will be attacking RUM with 3 while Italy tries to push through by sea. It doesn't take a genius to see that. Next time try and suggest a deal that actually has some appearance of sincerity otherwise it's just too easy to see through.", "Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.", "If what you say about you and Austria not having an alliance anymore is true, then it looks like you don't have any friends at all close to you. And I know you're feeling very strong right now, but you will lose all of that if you don't have a powerful alliance. We are both strong countries, and a war would basically mean both of us getting put out of the game", "For the record, I don't think you can hold off me, Austria, and Italy at the same time. Definitely not. And although I have no interest in an alliance with Austria, they will be my second option if you continue to be this bellicose.", "Also can you read? I never suggested Sev to Arm, nor did I ever say I would support you into Rum. Make sure you get the facts straight before you go on a rant like that.", "And one last thing. If everything happened like I said we should do it, you would have 8; 6 + 1(serbia) + 1(greece) + 1(bulgaria) -1(sev). But that doesn't mean I only get one. Have you noticed my units in Munich and Silesia by any chance? I think you were overreacting.", "So, I'm still up for an alliance. I think it would be in both of our best interests, and could be very powerful\" But you need to stop constantly saying shit like\"oh we never really worked it out\" or \"oh, I'm sorry it was too close to the adjudication period\", and then completely running over my ideas as soon as I say them. Sure, they weren't 100% ideal, or truthful. But we can talk, and work out the kinks instead of you going on this rant about how bad and unrealistic the plans are.", "I know you didn't say anything about sev to arm, that's your army I'm talking about having the potential to move there but more likely you just attack rum. And yeah I meant your offer to support me into bud not rum. That's what you said you would do but I can't beleive you would do that so don't include  it in the offer.", "ok, probably true", "But you can't know that lol", "So ummm.... do you want to try to make something worK?", "Sure", "Watch me trust you and get burnt. Looking forward to it", "I'll back off and attack Italy and you attack austria", "Can't give up sev though but you'll probably be able to take it anyway.", "Lol actually I was thinking \"watch me you and get burnt\"", "Great minds think allike I gues", "So what are our short term plans? I still strongly think you should take Serbia", "Also, just letting you know, I'm telling austria that I'm going to attack you and that I want to make an alliance to attack you, just thought I would let you know. Ofc it isn't true, I'm just trying ot get them to move where I want", "I'll just support myself in sev and rum which means you can take gal", "Army StP? Good luck with that one \ud83d\ude42 We had a chance vs France but you and Austria don't. I'll have the black sea this year and i'll be the Turkish Turtle for the rest of the game \ud83d\udc4d", "LOL. Some of you're own medicine turkey. I just can't believe how many times you said you would do something and then you didn't... Why would me and you have a better chance against france than me and austria?  And havn't you noticed my alliance... Well, good luck turkey. I can't see us doing anything together for the rest of the game if I'm going to be completely honest.", "Did you see my moves last season? They were exactly as I said. Thanks though, good luck to you too. You've got a good chance now to win! \ud83d\ude03", "Ok, now that I look at the moves again ig u didn't do anything you didn't say you would. But you didn't do anything that would benifit us, lke going for serbia or gre. Whatever, doesn't matter now. And who knows, if a miricle happened you could turn this game around and win it too!", "Hey, france is getting huge. I'm not suggesting an alliance as it appears nothing works against us, but maybe we could set some of our disputes to allow us to focus our energy on trying to prevent france from winning?", "If you give me berlin back, I can support you into edi", "I will happily do everything in my power to get you Berlin back :)", "WOW.

They did a pretty anti - Russian move there.", "I think England's moves might actually lean more pro Russia given that the army move failed and England will have to put a fleet in Norway.

Me and England are on pretty good terms as well, but I really hope they don't attack me. What do you think the likelihood of that is? I think later in the game an alliance between me, you, and England could be insanly powerful.", "My hope is that England supports himself into Denmark", "True", "True", "Hmm. It's honestly really tough to read England. I don't think they are going after you but they did mention taking Sweden earlier int he game so I might request a bounce in Norway or something like that", "So you think I should move to nwy? And do you think I should arrange a bounce or use it to stab. I don't really want to attack England", "Hmm. If you don't really want to attack England I would arrange a bounce probably. I don't know what Norwegian Sea is up to but it is probably best if it stays there", "There isn't a ton of time before the deadline so I'm not sure if England is online or not", "I told England to move from nwg to Edinburgh and they agreed in return for me support a move to denmark", "How close are you with England?", "Sweet. That works fine as long as England follows through", "Also rn I don't have any things I need w/ Warsaw. Anywhere you would like me to move it?", "I feel like if everything works out our alliance could last a long time and has potential to become very powerful.", "I don't actually think I'm that close to England right now, but we talk a lot. He's said he will help me against Germany and I am somewhat skeptical of whether he will follow through or not", "I don't thing Germany has many friends \ud83d\udc80", "If I move to Silesia with war, I could help you w/ germany", "I'd love to see that honestly", "Alright. Hopefully in return for support I could have Berlin and you would get the rest of Germany?", "Especially if the three of us work things out, you could drop down to the Baltic Sea and we'd be able to split Germany very quickly", "That sounds good to me", "Right. But things might not work out that great if I move into Nwy.", "Haha", "I'm kinda worried about attacking England, since that would mean England, Austria, and turkey all going after me and I don't think I can handle that.", "Yeah", "I need to go, but I'll be back in 10  min if you wana keep talking \ud83d\ude01", "Sounds good", "Here's a thought. If we're taking down Germany, it would make sense for you to support England to Denmark", "And then England moves North Sea to Helgoland, Norwegian Sea to North Sea, and Skaggerak to Denmark", "Unfortunately it seems that England is not online", "Do you know which unit England wanted to move to Denmark with?", "Yea I don't want to attack England. I think I will support instead.", "Perfect. I agree with your decision. After a brief convo with England I'm a lot less concerned about things because enow the stories are all matching up", "Soo... you did just talk to England, correct. Cuz I just messaged them and they are for sure online", "Yep I did talk to them. I think they were having connection issues earlier which is why I thought they were offline", "they say they are bouncing North Sea in EC", "Checks out. We organized a bounce rhere", "Wait by EC do you mean the English Channel?", "Yep", "Sorry about me moving into Norway. I was pretty worried they would attack me and some things didn\u2019t match up. Also I really needed the build. Now I feel bad cuz they we\u2019re completely honest \ud83d\ude2d. Hopefully England will accept my apology and we can continue our alliance?", "Honestly the build was worth it I think. Asutria and Turkey are seriously strong together and stopping them will be a lot harder than I first thought", "Yes. Thx for understanding.", "Turkey is crazy. They try to make a deal with me and they betray every time. Austria won\u2019t respond to my messages. And basically nobody can help me over there. So hopefully I will be able to hold them off and get some extra builds from Germany", "I wish Italy was a better player then they could help", "Anyways I need to go to bed now but talk in the morning", "Omfg turkey is ridiculous.", "They just said \u201c i did not have enough time to change my orders. Alliance still on\u201d", "Imma play gullible and just go with it \ud83d\ude02", "God", "Sorry for the all the messages", "Yeah they are def lying lol \ud83d\ude02", "Building Warsaw and Moscow I'm assuming?", "Oh crap, you retreated to Bohemia?", "As much as I love to see you in Bohemia, I worry you won't be able todefend your Homeland effectively", "Do you have relations with either rturkey or Austria?", "What's the deal with Norway?", "England says the alliance might work if I move out of nwy, which I probably will, since I can't have another enemy. Turkey thinks I am very gullible, and keeps saying we will attack Austria, but he is 100% lying. Austria won't respond to my press. I messed up with that retreat. Imma build in Moscow", "Damn", "They r letting me keep NWY", "Let\u2019s hope It\u2019s not a stab, but I don\u2019t think it is", "We should coordinate orders. I think Germany plans to take Burgundy so I am currently defending it and imagine any supports it gives will be cut.", "Can Bohemia head to Munich to cut Munich support though? I want to get clever and see if I can get away with this move but it relies on Munich's support being cut.", "Also do you have any reads on England? I could move into Ska but only if I'm sure they won't attack", "Sure. Do you want me to go as for as to support my move into Munich, or do you think Sil should head back to War instead?", "Oops. Not SKA. Nvm", "HellO?", "Hey", "Not a good read on England right now. But he told me he wouldn't attack you if that helps", "I would not move Silesia to Warsaw because you want to make sure Ukraine has a valid retreat option", "I don't think a supported move on Munich will work right now, but that's what I'd lean towards unless you want to do a tactical pull back with Moscow-Livonia Ukraine-Moscow and silesia-Warsaw", "Nah", "silesia could also go to Galicia", "To cut support and hopefully keep Ukraine", "rn I'm having Moscow to sev", "with Ukraine supporting", "sil to gal", "boh to mun", "Sounds pretty good", "I'm pretending to be in an alliance with turkey and I told them I was moving out of Moscow into Warsaw, so hopefully they will take the bait and move there instead of to gal", "True", "Here's a tentative plan for the fall:\nKiel-Berlin\nBohemia-Munich\nSilesia S Bohemia-Munich\nBurgundy-Ruhr\nEnglish Channel S Picardy-Belgium\nPicardy-Belgium\nHelgoland-Holland\nNorth Sea S Helgoland-Holland", "This guarantees you Munich (unless something weird like Austria moves Galicia to Silesia??).", "It guarantees England Holland and guarantees me Belgium. And England already has Kiel.", "Basically, Germany loses 4 dots in one turb", "And if Ukraine goes to Warsaw, I think you'll be well defended and can build (since you are picking up munich) in St Petersburg. This way, you'll be able to defend Warsaw and Moscow too", "Thoughts? There may be room for refinements.", "Sorry, gtg to bed. Talk in morning", "Any new thoughts so we don't run too close to the deadline again \ud83d\ude05", "Yeh I agree. I like your plan.", "And Ig mos would just move to sev?", "bwahahahaha", "I'm trying to get turkey to work with me. If they actually do that would be AMAZING as first we could crush Austria and then I could stab them", "Moscow to Sev makes sense", "It would be great if Turkey did that! Though I worry Turkey might not go for that as my communication this year with him made it seem like Turkey was not interested in stabbing Austria.", "I sent England the orders u sent me btw", "yea. All they have done this game is stab me, so I would be suprised if they actually did't lie this time.", "I feel like turkey might be on board... we\u2019ll see soon. If he is, Austria will lose two supply centers. If he\u2019s not, I should be ok", "Nice!!! Had we known about the German NMR, we could have eliminated him this turn. That being said, this is still good.", "What are you thinking for builds? It depends on how you feel about England, but if you can trust them then A Warsaw would make sense", "Rn I'm just laughing  at Austria and turkey", "Turkey had such a good chance to stab Austria, he could have gotten two of their territories and put them out of the game, but instead he continues his war with Austria against me and they can't even capture any territories \ud83d\ude02.", "Idk about England so far they have been completely honest but they just asked me if they could convoy one of their armies into Livonia so they could help help defend my centers but I don't think I trust them enough for that", "Yeah haha, I think you might even have the chance to retake Sebastopol next year at this rate", "On second thought, you might need the unit in Livonia honestly. It looks like Austria is intent on taking Bohemia, supporting themselves to Silesia, to then cut Warsaw support to take Ukraine, and then take Moscow. It's a 3 season maneuver, but it honestly is what is going to happen.", "I just asked Turkey why he isn't stabbing Austria. He replied that he is playing to solo. So I guess his thought is that he'll keep Austria as a puppet for the entire game and hopefully eek out enough progress to then brutally stab Austria on the last turn.", "With these kinds of players, you kind of have to just hunker down and form coalitions to fight against them... and honestly the only reason it is working is Italy is just letting them make so much progress in the Med.", "I am having trouble keeping in contact with Italy, but what I want to do is work with him closely in the Med and put up a lot of fleet pressure in the south.", "If you can get in touch with Italy, it would be awesome to try and convince him to help with that", "k", "We should start planning our moves", "Also what are you thinking for the future of our alliance?", "For sure. It does depend a little bit on English builds, but I honestly think that for the short term future we should be applying pressure on Austria and Turkey until they are forced to fight each-other.", "On my side, I'll be trying to work with Italy. If Italy remains uncooperative, I may have to move to attack them.", "What are your thoughts though?", "I am pretty confident that Austria will support Bohemia to Silesia. For that reason, I recommend:\nWarsaw S Silesia H \nMunich-Berlin\nKiel S Munich-Berlin\nBurgundy-Munich", "I'll send this to England as well", "Thoughts?", "The safest way would be something like this:\nWarsaw S Ukraine\nMoscow S Ukraine\nMunich S Silesia", "New thought:\nUkraine-Sevastopol\nMoscow S Ukraine-Sevastopol\nWarsaw-Galicia\nSilesia S Warsaw-Galicia\nMunich-Berlin\nKiel S Munich-Berlin\nBurgundy-Munich\n\nThis move set has all of the advantages of both move sets", "Ok, I'm here now. I know I have said this every time, but I think I might have something with turkey", "We are working stuff out rn. They said they arn't in an alliance with austria anymore which, based off last turns moves, is totally plausible.", "Also, what do you think about turkey? If you have looked at their moves throughout this games and their alliances (basically none) it seems evident that either they arn't very committed to the game, or they are just bad at it. I have communicated with them a few times, but they don't really seem interested in talking.", "I like you're moves. Although would Burgundy to munich be permanant? Or just moving through?", "Also I think you should go to war with Italy. They are weak, play bad, and are getting closed in on from all sides(if you attack them). Try not to let turkey get all their territories and become to strong \ud83d\ude05", "I was thinking that, I am waiting for replies from Italy and England first though.", "ok", "Think I should try to play austria and turkey against eachother for Rum so I am garunteed to get it (if austria attacks)?", "I am looking to get another build soon to get another fleet on Italy, so as long as you were taking Berlin, and it looks like you aren't in immediate trouble, it would make sense to make the trade as I feel it is a bit more natural. But it's a bit to early to definitively say", "If you can get them to fight that would be ideal, but I am 99% sure Turkey is lying", "how so?", "I'm paraphrasing, but Turkey told me he was not going to attack Austria because he wants to eliminate you first", "oof", "ok", "So is England on board w/ Munich to Berlin?", "Also did you see england's builds? Given their position they are most likely going to turn on one of us and recruit the other to help out pretty soon...", "They don't really have anyone to attack but me or you", "Also I would really preffer you not move into Munich. There is a good chance I won't get Berlin anyways if england doesn't support", "I haven't heard back on the support to Berlin yet unfortunately so it might be best to operate on the assumption it will not happen for now", "I am currently not moving to Munich, but let me know if England talks to you", "Ok", "Heard anything from England?", "You're right, they probably intend to attack one of us. The builds make it ambiguous to who they plan to fight.", "If they do, should we work together too take them out? The builds of only troops imply a convoy, so I think it would wipe most of their opportunities if we took out NTH... but then again, they might not attack us", "I can support Norway to North Sea", "But I agree with your analysis that they want to convoy out, so taking North Sea would definitely slow them down a lot", "So do you want me to move to the North Sea? They are saying that they are going to convoy to Italy but that seems implausible...", "Up to you, I'm happy to hold", "Ok sure, let\u2019s wait one more turn. So for England has been true to their word, so..", "Sounds good", "Nice job getting Austria to turn on Turkey!", "So, just by the board position we have two options.\n1. Take Holland and North Sea from England this turn. I would bounce Italy out of Munich and you would get a build, presumably a fleet in St Petersburg.\n2. We don't attack England since he's been a very reliable ally, and commit fully to the attack on Italy and Turkey. This would look like sending all of my fleets south, so it would mean losing the option to efficiently attack England later, and also potentially leave us open to being stabbed by England.", "Any thoughts or suggestions?", "Regarding the Austrian retreat from Galicia, I think it makes sense to retreat to Ukraine and take Rumania from Ukraine. That way, Turkey won't be able to retreat Rumania to Ukraine.", "I sent this to Austria as a recommendation and thought I'd share with you too:\nUkraine-Rumania\nMoscow S Sevastopol H\nBudapest S Serbia H\nSerbia S Ukraine-Rumania\nGalicia S Ukraine-Rumania", "Silesia-Warsaw is necessary as well I think in case Austria stabs you", "I don't really want to turn on England... but we could", "They told me you told them you didn't want to convoy their troops, and they said they didn't know what to do with them", "So what are we doing about munich", "??", "France... I need a response to get my orders in. If you see this in time please move one(w/o) support unit to Munich. Then you might bounce Italy but you might get it which would be ok to ig", "Sorry for the late response", "I was thinking that in order for my armies to be useful, I inevitably need to be moving through Munich to get to Tyrolia and other key territories anyway, so it seems more natural to me to have Munich and for you to have Berlin. There is also the fact that I kind of need a build right now, so if we are not attacking England I would like to have Munich as you are already picking up Berlin and Sevastopol.", "Awesome- looks like you have one supply center open for building in St Petersburg and one build, which works out perfectly.", "We need to get you a build this year so you can put a fleet in Sevastopol", "Wow you got lucky... got one of my territories and two of Italy\u2019s...", "If we\u2019re going to abandon our English ally, I\u2019ll build a fleet... but if not, prob an army", "So... England, or no?", "It's now or never, I say we should go for it", "I have to say though, I really like England as a player, so it's a lot tougher of a call than I'm letting on.", "I think though that you could get away with building an army and moving it to Finland, as to not set off any warning signs. Finland has a lot of advantages including the ability to defend both Sweden and Norway", "So I would probably build an army in St Petersburg even if you are on board with attacking England", "I also do want to wait for builds since I actually might not be able to even attack England due to Italy, Austria, and Turkey hating my guts", "How are things with Austria? Hearing anything interesting lately?", "Intial thoughts:\nMoscow-Sevastopol\nSevastopol-Ukraine\nGalicia-Bohemia\nWarsaw-Galicia\n\nThis achieves a strong position to corner Italy as well as potentially bounces with Armenia, allowing you to build F Sevastopol in the winter", "Anti English:\nNorway-North Sea\nBerlin-Kiel\nMunich S Berlin-Kiel\nRuhr-Holland\nBelgium S Ruhr-Holland\nEnglish Channel S Norway-North Sea", "This accomplishes the goal of getting you a build in Kiel, and takes the North Sea, Holland, and Belgium all in one turn.", "If you'd like, we can probably wait to make this move in the fall so that England will immediately have to pull two units off the board for builds", "I'm up for doing it this turn. Or next. I will also move Stp to Finla d", "Sounds good- let's wait a turn then", "Ok. I will still move to finland this turn ig. Hopefuly that doesn't send off any alarms to england, though it probably will. but I can say something like \"it doesn't really have anywhere else to go, and it's just for safety seeing as you attacked berlin last turn\"... or something along those lines", "So, if I'm going to be completly honest here(something that doesn't often happen in this game \ud83d\ude43), I'm a little bit worried about you getting a few more supply centres and running off with the game. You took Munich from me, and then also two of italys. Nine supply centres and a good position. A little bit disturbing, if you can understand. And no, this doens't mean I'm calling off our alliance, or teaming up with enland,(that would be stupid of me as they are completely stranded).  So we are both strong countries, and could probably get away with a two way win, but are you at all interested in that?", "True. If we do it right, a fall stab should be unpreventable even if England does suspect something.", "I appreciate you bringing up concerns: I would definitely be interested in a two-way win. It might be comforting to know that the supply center gap is absolutely temporary as Italy and Austria will work together to push me out of both Rome and Naples (not to mention, the fact that it ties up 4-5 of my units just to the Italian front). That on top of getting you a build this year should even things out, if not put things in your favor.", "Yea. Too early to tell about a lot of this stuff. Here's to a good alliance\ud83e\udd42!", "We should both keep talking to england; maybe suggest some orders that would make our attack more effective", "True. Just to be safe, it would be a good idea to dislodge the north Sea and prevent any convoys. It's going to mean England will know what's up, but I think our attack is unstoppable anyway. I think I can do this with just Belgium and English Channel", "It might be smart to move Norway-Sweden and St Petersburg-Norway in order to try and make a play for Denmark too next year", "Oh man I wish I could have seen that in time so we could have coordinated...", "Oh well", "No worries", "I am supporting Berlin to Kiel so absolutely make sure Sevastopol is open for a fleet build (probably Moscow-Sevastopol and Ukraine-Sevastopol). Also try not to let Turkey find out, because otherwise he might try to support you into Sev", "Any thoughts on what you want to do with Norway?", "Ok sounds good. Nwy will move to Ska maybe to take denmark, since you are already big and it wouldn't really make sense for you to have it after this turn(so take it this turn and I'll take it back and support u somewhere else instead) if thats ok with yo", "Sounds good regarding moving to Skag. We can definitely organize a way to split up English supply centers, though I am a bit cautious of doing it now since I expect to be losing supply centers in the short term (to Austria).", "So you moved to the North Sea. What gives?", "Yeah last minute I decided that was a better position, since one of us should probalby occupy it, and it also has access to denmark. I hope that's ok and doesn't come accross as agressive. I will totally move out of there next turn if u ask me too, since you have more fleets that need to get out into the sea", "But I think that turn went amazing; I got rum from austria, and bounced in sev. Looks like you did pretty well too. I think if we continue this alliance, we could totally win", "I think I will go with an army in warsaw, instead of a fleet in Stp, since I broke off the relationship with austria, and england doesn't seem like a threat. IS that good with you or would you preffer me to build in Stp, to get Enland out of the game quickly?", "Cool- we might be better off with you in the North Sea actually since it opens up the option to convoy to the island next turn. It depends somewhat on English disbands. Warsaw is fine with me- I agree with your logic, and we probably have enough units for England anyway", "Great! Thanks mate", "You didn't build a fleet in Sevastopol?", "The weak point in England's defense is Edinburgh so we should try to find a way to take that", "Oh god I messed up.", "Forgot to build", "It happens sometimes. I think you still have a strong position in the south unless Turkey and Austria start working together again", "Thoughts on sending north Sea to Norwegian Sea? I worry that a convoy is easily distrupted but Edinburgh is easy to take if we do that", "Any ideas for Trieste?", "How is a convoy easily disrupted? You realize that one has to dislodge a unit in order to stop it from convoying. And france can't do that. Although Ig they could stay in edi, but moving to the norwegian wouldn't change anything about that", "If you're there we can plan our moves", "I can keep kiel and berlin, right? Since you got the rest of germany. So w/ my unit in kiel maybe i should go to denmark? Or i could do that with sweden", "Triest could support me into venice?", "Do you want me to convoy one of you're units to edi?", "Although me moving to venice is pretty risky, if austrai and turkey team up", "You could say something to austrai about an alliance to try to get them not too attack you", "sorry for all the messages lol", "How about this:\nA Gal - Vie\nA Kie\nA Mos - Sev\nF NTH\nA Rum\nA Swe - Den\nA Ukr S Rum\nA War - Gal\n\nA Tri - Ser\nA Hol - Edi", "Because England will move Wales to Yorkshire and thus there is no way to convoy to the island", "NTH-Norwegian Sea IMO so that I can move my fleet to the North Sea but everything else seems ok", "ok. Any suggestions? So i'm assuming you will move to serbia?", "W/ my fleet in nrth sea i will support you into england if you do me that favor", "also ig kiel will just chill?", "I think I have to defend Venice from Austria but I will try to get Austria to make some bad moves", "I think it makes sense to hold in Kiel", "Maybe move it back to Berlin or something", "I could move to Serbia it just means I'll lose Venice and Trieste too and Edinburgh is unfortunately not guaranteed, so I think I'd have to keep Denmark in that scenario to avoid losing 3 supply centers in one turn", "That's not entirly fair... chances are you will loose either venice OR triest", "And when im in viena i can help u into bud", "So how about we go with what I said, and I don't take denmark this turn but I will take it next turn(or maybe not) depending on what u have for supply centrs", "idk what do u think would be best for both of us on the whole", "That works for me", "k. I won't move to denmark this turn then", "I really hope you don't betray me as I think that would be bad for both of us in the long run and if we stick together we are basicaly garunteed a win at this point, but if we fight it could escalate and we would destroy eachother", "lol", "I agree- betraying at this point would be short-sighted. In many ways, you are better positioned to stab me than I am to stab you since I have so many units tied up in Italy, Austria, and Turkey.", "Well, i can't say I agree with the latter, but I agree with your first point \ud83d\ude18", "lol france", "i sorta knew u would do that but I wanted to give u a chance", "I have to be honest I\u2019m pretty disappointed about that", "\ud83d\ude2d", "Ig I overestimated", "I know what this looks like, and I think you should make whichever moves make you more comfortable, but I needed to find a way to convince Austria to work with me against Turkey in the fall and split them up, so as a condition I put in these moves. That being said, it's a spring move, and so my plan is to reverse the spring by walking back out of Kiel and Berlin", "I have to say that the Austrian moves were an unexpected and great surprise, as it will be putting massive strains on Turkey and Austria working together in the long run.", "If anything, you have a build in pocket, and are picking up Vienna and Budapest.  If I was going to stab you I would have chosen a different turn and told Austria about you moving to Vienna", "LOL nice try France. If your going to try to persuade me that taking two of my centers isn't betraying me, then I don't know what too say. And why in the world would you need Austria to work with you against turkey? You're overrunning the map, and turkey is probably the least of your concern right now. If you didn't want this too be a betrayal, you could have told me and worked something out beforehand. And yes, I have a build(s) on my hand, but unless you actually do as you say, and move out of my centers, I won't really have a chance for winning. I could have gotten you in Denmark, and although I considered it I didn't.", "But if you do want to work something out and move out of my centers that would be pretty nice ...\ud83d\ude01", "I mean, you will definitely be in the draw if that's what you meant. I would have 100% proposed this beforehand, but I felt that the plan might be jeapordized if you weren't fully on board. I get that you feel like you have to move to defend yourself and in that sense it unfortunately makes sense for me to hold onto Kiel and Berlin since I expect to be losing 2 supply centers in the south, and it seems like you aren't interested in supporting North Sea to Edinburgh.", "Turkey is a cunning player and I fear that with the right tactical positioning Turkey would be able to conquer the Mediterranean\uff0cespecially since I only have 3 fleets to his 4, and considering the superior defensive and offensive position of Turkey on the map in regards to naval power.", "you keep saying your going to lose centers and you never do... your probably going to take munich...", "You say you didn't stab me but you are bieng completly unreasonable in everything that you are saying.", "In this (not losing centers) I truly have been extraordinarily lucky, but it is bound to end at some point.", "Well you can't know that.", "So what do you want to do", "16 min to figure this out", "It's just highly unlikely, but I guess it is still theoretically possible for me to continue growing this turn. Next turn it is impossible as I will no longer be bordering any supply centers that I can possibly take", "So i'm assuming you're going to take munich?", "ANd your unwilling to give me berlin or kiel back?", "My pitch would be eliminating Italy, Austria, and England and going for a 3-way draw with Turkey since at this point we can't eliminate Turkey by 1910. Not sure what your relationship with Turkey is like?", "I'm open to the possibility of giving back either and/or not taking Munich. I think it makes sense for me to keep them unless we can figure out a deal with Edinburgh", "Also england might be difficult to get down quickly unless we get builds as fleets and send them over there which kind of feels like a waste", "OH god, don't get me started on turkey. They are really hard to agree with. But that is the most likely outcome. Although if you get a few more centers from austria and stab me u will win.", "It's not likely when I'm still on 12, but yeah the other alternative is to keep either England or Austria alive and settle for a 4 way draw", "If you want me to trust you I think you should give at least one back, as you are much bigger and frankly it's probably in your best interest to go for the solo, although if the rest of the contries cooperate you almost certaintly won't get it. And your definitly going to need me if you want to go for the draw", "But no lets not do 4 way", "|f your going to give me one back I think it would make most sense if I had berlin, but you would most likely move berlin to Pru or Sil which is scary even in the most trusting relationship", "That's fair. I agree, the difference between 3 way and 4 way is pretty significant.", "I think a three way is probably possible", "Should I message turkey", "Sure", "Do you know anything about Austria's moves?", "Unless you give me back/let me keep one of them, I don't think I will agree to bieng your ally, and this game will probably end in a 5 way draw hard cap", "No idea about austria", "So berlin will move to silesia", "?", "Ahh", "1 minute", "That's a reasonable position to take- I can give you one back for sure. Though maybe it makes more sense to support you to Edinburgh for a similar effect and not having me move to Silesia?", "ok we have one min change ur orders", "no time to work out something for edi", "lol this is stressful", "next time we need to work out something before this close to adjudication", "Damn! I changed my orders but they didn't go through for some reason", "Shit", "Yeah that was cutting it way to close", "I don't know if I can believe you but now were fucked", "this is really bad", "lost rum", "and didn't get bud", "That was extremely unlucky in the south, Turkey and Austria guessed completely correctly somehow", "ANd wow ur working with turkey?", "Ok I need to go]", "Tmrow maybe we can try to work out a 3 way draw", "Hmm. More like the move mutually benefits us as it means he isn't in the Gulf of Lyons and also means Italy is eliminated", "yeh ig", "Alright, we'll talk tomorrow for sure", "Alhtough tbh u might be able to get the solo", "If you go for it gl", "The south did go very lucky for me last turn, but I don't think the dots that I need are within reach for at least a couple years- thanks though lol", "So the *best way* to go for the 3 way draw right now would be for me to move North Sea to Yorkshire and move Skaggerak to North Sea while you convoyed an army from Norway into Clyde. This way, we can take both London and Edinburgh in the fall, and next year I would support you to Liverpool", "In the south you can easily take Serbia and Budapest provided that you can actually work with Turket", "What are you thinking for builds?

Considering that both of you are rather powerful with your early builds, I didn't want to overcommit to one side before I knew I could reasonably trust in my own safety. As such, I not move turn 1 EC against you, and I didn't move into Denmark.", "I realize that might be exceptionally frustrating, but hopefully you understand why I might be incredibly cautious with only one build.", "That said, I had a lot more to lose in this situation than you. Now that I know I can trust you in our efforts against Germany, I would be more than willing to use my navy to help your cause.", "That's great to hear, but I need an actual commitment. I'd like to see you build fleet Edinburgh (or an army).

Just as a heads up, Germany has been telling me that he would send his fleet in Holland to North Sea if I withdrew from Munich. Probably a lie, but thought I'd mention it.", "I'm very close with Russia in terms of our relationship, and I just realized that you and Russia can take Denmark from Germany this turn. Is that something you are interested in? I would definitely ask Russia if they can support you into Denmark in the fall when you are in the North Sea", "Also, any thoughts on how I might keep Munich?

If only there were an army in Munich willing to help out!", "I'm very happy to see your moves. Whild convoying London to Denmark is tempting, I think it makes the most sense to send Skaggerak to Denmark for two reasons.", "Firstly, Russia is the only thing preventing Turkey and Austria from rapid expansion, which is something we need to prevent in case either of them get in a dominant position in the east to the point of soloing, or being too big to take out in the future.", "Secondly, a fleet in Denmark can support a fleet from the North Sea into the Helgoland Blight, which is important in case Holland tries to bounce that move. Getting that fleet there is necessary if we hope to take Holland or Kiel in the future.", "By the way, pretty much everything I've told Germany this turn is a lie. Just so you know", "Can you move your Brest fleet down south? I'd prefer not to leave my backdoor unlocked, and nothing I have will be able to capitalize on that. That said, I'll be moving into Denmark", "Are you comfortable if it goes to Picardy again? I want to try and corner Belgium.", "Germany is insisting that you told him that you'd attack me next, which is concerning since I am a logical target, and it's \"pretty much everything\" is a lie", "Depends.", "Look. You helped me out a ton last turn my moving out of the English Channel and building the fleet in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Germany built 2 armies, used them against me to take a dot from me (I have a disband this turn), and tried to take Picardy. I'm not going to forget that.\n\nI'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the future either. Germany is the largest threat to me right now, and I can't overextend against you without worrying about Italy who has a fleet in Rome (which can only move West).", "Not to mention. You have a build coming and I have a disband. There's no chance I can win in a fight against you. Germany is trying to show discord between us because he knows it's the only chance he has to survive if we start working together. And for the record, I told him I'd be attacking you right now *if and only if* he gives me Belgium (this is a lie, but I'm hoping that I can snag Belgium this turn). I did not say anything about attacking you after splitting up Germany (and in general I like to deal with the present situation instead of making long-term plans, since the board is constantly changing).\n\nI'll be around to talk more later today, but hopefully that assuaged some of your fears", "Okay. I will continue to support you against Germany. However, I will only accept Brest into Picardy if MAO moves south. You have other things to worry about, but I'm not going to open up my coasts without an insurance policy. I will move into Denmark, ideally with Russian support, and we can see how the situation progresses from there.", "If you maintain our alliance for the duration of the conflict against Germany, I will surrender Belgium and Holland to you as well", "I will 100% do that if that is what we want to do. I don't mean to push it too much (as I realize just Picardy is a large trust excersize), but in the interest of full disclosure, I was initially planning to send MAO to the English Channel. I wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily. If you do allow that, you would have control over what we do with that unit- whether that's convoying London to Belgium, cutting Belgium support to try and capture Holland, or sending it to Belgium with supports from Burgundy and Picardy.", "I can see why you'd want MAO in EC. As a compromise, you can keep MAO where it is instead of moving south, and maybe EC next. Picardy and EC are two big bites, and being able to take them one at a time would go far in my comfort with that move.", "Sounds great! Thanks. Let me know if you find out anything about what Germany plans to do (I will do the same, but at this point I don't think he'd share any reliable info with me).", "Lol Germany is mad at me I don't think I'm gonna get much either", "I can't imagine he is not telling you anything. He has to be telling you something.", "If he's telling you that he will give you Denmark, he is lying. You need to support yourself to there", "He offered me Belgium to turn on you thats it", "He hasn't mentioned Denmark", "Interesting.", "Do you know what Russia is doing with Sweden?", "I asked him to support me into Denmark, but he hasn't been replying so idk if he will", "Yeah it seems like most of the players are not replying, probably due to the labor day weekend.", "Yeah that makes sense.", "Germany thinks I'm going to turn on you for belgium.", "Is he giving you Belgium right now?", "Is he giving you Belgium right now?", "I don't think it's possible for him to give you Belgium unless he makes some wacky moves into the Helgoland Blight and to Holland", "I don't think he is. He believes it'll be a long term exchange", "Are you online", "Are you online?", "My connection kind of sucks but I'm here", "What's up?", "Russia was just saying he'd support you to Denmark", "This changes a lot in terms of plans because one thing you can do now is move North Sea to Helgoland and Norwegian Sea to North Sea", "He wants me to send Nor west so idk if that will fly with him.", "You'd be able to conviy into Kiel or Holland next Spring and take the other in the fall for two dots", "Yeah he told me he wanted you to put it in Edinburgh", "I'd be fine with that but it's a regressive move. If anything, Russia is just worried that you'll attack him", "Other option if you want to be safe is we can bounce in the English Channel", "It's slower but we can do all this stuff next year anyway as long as you stay in North Sea", "I'm glad since Russia's silence was really worrying me, but it seems like he was just away for the weekend", "Alright that sounds good to me. NWG will go to Edi, North Sea can bounce EC, and Ska will take Denmark.", "And yeah I was worried too but all is well so that's comforting.", "Sounds good. Ordered and in", "You may want to move London out of the way since your re going to have a build and I assume you don't want to build in liverpool", "That's a marvelous point thanks for mentioning that.", "So Russia", "We probably should have seen that coming since zRussia does honestly really need the build to stop Turkey Austria from rolling over him", "Depending on what Russia says you should decide between spending effort to evict Russia from Norway or letting it go", "Russia said there was a discrepancy between what you're telling and him and what I told him. What did you communicate to him about my moves?", "I just need to find out if he legitimately thought he was in danger or if he acted with malice.", "We talked a lot and pretty fast, so there is a chance some things got lost in translation. But basically I just told him we were bouncing in the channel and we had worked things out", "Alright cool. He went to bed but I'm gonna figure out my move in the morning.", "Any ideas on what you want your next steps to be? I don't think Russia stabbed you from malice. If anything I think we'll see with Russias builds that he does not want to get into conflict with you", "If it is possible to work through this, we need to start working on attacking Germany ASAP. Right now it's a clusterfuck and Austria Turkey are going to roll over the West if we don't work together", "Being deprived of a build really kills my momentum on fighting Germany.  One of my fleets will go into securing Norway, and i'll also try to move against Germany with one of my fleets", "Edi will probably end up in the North Sea", "Russia didn't like me having so many fleets near him but he stabbed me so he's gonna have to deal with it lol", "If Edi will end up in the North Sea, where is North Sea headed? To Helgoland Blight?", "NS will go Nor", "Makes sense. I'm assuming you worked it out with Russia since otherwise it would probably bounce", "He said he'd vacate Nor so here's hoping lol", "You seem very hesitant to attack either Germany or me. You have to commit to one side at some point though, or else nobody will make any progress while Turkey starts decimating the East and soloes.", "I would highly recommend letting Russia keep Norway for now because he will need the units against Turkey, and you can always take Norway back later", "Meanwhile, you have a really good opportunity to take some German centers", "Idk it seems like you aren't worried about Turkey/Austria at all.", "You should be very worried. Think about them as an 11 center power. They're going to roll over Italy and Russia very, very quickly", "It seems like you are so far away, so you don't have to worry about it. But the truth is that they don't need a single one of your supply centers for one of them to win the game.", "As far as I can tell, Turkey is the stronger partner and Austria is mostly just going along with it. I've been trying for the past 2 years to get them to fight unsuccessfully, though you are welcome to try", "If this pattern continues we will see Turkey stab Austria once the solo is in sight", "It's so much easier to stop right now rather than later. Or in fact, instead of stopping it we could just create a stronger counter-alliance", "That's why I want Russia to be as strong as possible right now to stop the AT in their tracks. If you don't want to do that I think we have to hit Germany hard right now. Maybe you can move to the Helgoland and take Norway in the fall?", "While I reasonably hesitated to involve myself in the conflict with a Germany, the fact that I have taken Denmark (and intend to continue attacking with the fleet in Denmark) ought to indicate that I'm no longer hesitating to commit. While Turkey/Austria is a significant threat in the late game, I'm also concerned with not being eliminated in the short-term. The fact of the matter is that I am surrounded by powers who can stab me with devastating effect (you) or powers who have in fact stabbed me (Russia) or would stab if given the chance (Germany). I am more than willing to hit Germany right now and move South from Denmark, but I also need to cover my bases and get Nor. Russia can have centers in Germany to combat AT.", "I'm willing to be the weaker power in the interest of countering AT, but I am inclined to think that holding Denmark and Nor is a very reasonable minimum.", "Very fair, thanks for writing out your thoughts. We'll see what happens but you probably will grow faster than I can. Germany has so many armies that any successful attack on him hinges on you (and Russia to some extent)", "Alright. Where do you want the Danish fleet to move? Has Russia communicated a plan with his armies? I'll communicate to Russia that if I have Norway he can take his picking of German centers to combat AT", "Makes sense to move it to Kiel I think?", "Yeah I was thinking actually that it would make sense to put Russia into munich", "Russia disappeared again but hopefully we can work that out", "Hey I just told Russia he can keep Nor for now.", "I really don't want to have to deal with Turkey pushing up to StP or something", "Awesome! Russia told me he would build an army in Moscow, so if he guesses right he might be able to keep Turkey out for now", "Everything looks good right now. If you sill plan to let Russia keep Norway then I would recommend ordering North Sea-Helgoland Blight, Denmark - Kiel, and Edinburgh-North Sea. Best case scenario, you end up in Helgoland Blight, Kiel, and North Sea and can take Holland in the fall for a total of both Kiel and Holland", "I recommend this because I believe that Germany trusts you and that he will not make an attempt to defend Kiel, especially if you tell him that you have your hands full with Russia and me.", "I hate to ruin the party but there is no chance in hell that Germany trusts me. They have fully stopped replying to me.", "That said, I'm sure their hands are full anyway, so I'll move into Kiel", "Oh haha. Well, he isn't talking to me either, so I guess he may have given up \ud83d\ude02", "I need you tell me whether or not the idea I just had is stupid. If Russia trusts the FER alliance, I could totally convoy army to Livonia and support any of the centers neighboring it. Is that even worth proposing or should it stay in my head?", "Support Russia defending I mean.", "It's worth proposing but maybe not at this point since it will take a while to set up anyway. That's a great idea for the future I think", "What's your goal with EC?", "Literally just to take Belgium- after that it will go south or help you if needed", "Alright. I'm gonna trust that since conflict among FER is a bad look given AT", "Here's a tentative plan:\nKiel-Berlin\nBohemia-Munich\nSilesia S Bohemia-Munich\nBurgundy-Ruhr\nEnglish Channel S Picardy-Belgium\nPicardy-Belgium\nHelgoland-Holland\nNorth Sea S Helgoland-Holland", "You have almost nothing to worry about- you can cover London this turn and have a strong chance to get 2 builds", "You are guaranteed Holland under this tentative plan", "Okay sounds good", "And unless Germany uses Munich or Ruhr to take Kiel (highly unlikely), you'll get that too", "I'll copy this plan to Russia and we can refine it if necessary then", "Alright. Let me know what Russia's thoughts are", "Will do.", "Russia said he liked the plan", "Alrighty cool", "Darn. If we knew Germany was submitting all hold orders, we could have eliminated him this turn! That being said, this is great progress", "Now we should start talking about next steps. I think now would be a good time to pitch the Livonia thing", "Any thoughts for builds? Also, any recommendations/requests for my build?", "I'd love to attack Italy, but I don't want to pull him away from defending Austria/Turkey. It's hard to say if he'd end up getting very angry and throwing supply centers to Turkey. It's a delicate balance", "I will talk to Russia about Livonia. I don't think this is a good time to attack Italy. It would be better for you to support him in the while Russia, presumably with my support, holds/pushes east. It is also possible for me to send fleets around Iberia into med to help out with supporting Italy. I will be building armies. My fleets will not be super useful in the conflict to come, but armies can help russia a lot.", "Makes sense. I agree with all of that.", "I sent this to russia", "I am pretty confident that Austria will support Bohemia to Silesia. For that reason, I recommend:\nWarsaw S Silesia H \nMunich-Berlin\nKiel S Munich-Berlin\nBurgundy-Munich", "New thought:\nUkraine-Sevastopol\nMoscow S Ukraine-Sevastopol\nWarsaw-Galicia\nSilesia S Warsaw-Galicia\nMunich-Berlin\nKiel S Munich-Berlin\nBurgundy-Munich\n\nThis move set has all of the advantages of both move sets", "Anyway, it wasn't clear whether Russia wanted you to move to Livonia or not after my conversation with him, but I think it might be worthwhile to convoy to Denmark to set up for it anyway?", "Sorry about the delay I've been in class all morning. I asked Russia and they were not into it", "Ok. That's a tough spot to be in. So what were you planning to do instead?", "If you are up for it, I can move to English Channel and Mid Atlantic Ocean, and then convoy Wales to North Africa.", "I know you recommended earlier that I work with Italy, but lately I haven't been able to get in contact with him. If that continues, I think our best course of action is moving quickly to try and take those centers before Turkey and Austria do.", "I know you are busy- but let's try to nail down a plan before the deadline this time around.", "I'll be back around later in the day.", "Alright I've only got class for another couple of hours today so we can talk then", "Any new thoughts or updates?", "I think Italy is a good target if they're not helping the cause", "Have you heard anything new from Russia?", "Nothing new or interesting. They want support to kill Germany", "Sounds good", "Hello! Would you like to set up that Naf convoy next turn?", "I think so. That being said, the timing does feel a little bit off if we do it now. I also don't really know what the deal is regarding Italy, Austria, and Turkey", "I really need a build right now, and even though Russia is getting two builds, he seems reluctant to hand off Munich to me as previously discussed. I wonder if it would be possible for Kiel to cut Berlin's support in case Russia gets greedy and tries to support Silesia to Munich?", "Are you sure he can't be convinced to surrender it to you? If I hit him in Berlin that might breakup FER", "Have you talked to Russia about Mun today?", "Unfortunately not, as I've been very busy with everything that has been going on.", "Alright based on what he told me he intends to keep it", "I can't get a response from him at the moment, but I just told him my intentions to support myself there.", "In order to keep Munich, Russia would have to use Silesia and support himself to Munich", "Alright. Do you need me to do anything or am I chillin?", "Kiel to Berlin would be amazing", "Alright", "Thanks for that- it ultimately wasn't necessary. And wow- did not expect to pick up either Rome and Venice, which actually hurts a lot in terms of containing Italy. I'm sure Austria and Italy will be attacking me next.", "Sorry- forgot to add that cutting Berlin makes me even more comfortable than I already was in swinging the rest of my units towards Italy", "How do you feel about Russia right now?", "Seems like our alliance is getting pretty testy but he hasn't responded since Berlin so idk for sure", "Well this is awkward", "If you're willing to cooperate, I would be more than willing to surrender German centers in exchange for peace.", "Besides, stuff like Kie or even NTH makes it look like you and Russia are only sort of on the same page.", "I am more than happy to coordinate- it honestly has been very busy over the past few days for me so I haven't been able to talk with you or Russia that much.", "There's no getting around it: I need builds to fuel a campaign against Italy and Turkey in the south. I'm glad you are looking for an opportunity to make this as amicable as possible- I definitely don't intend on going after the island (hence, sending Brest to MAO rather than the English Channel). On top of not being necessary, your coasts are extremely well defended.", "That's the beauty of leaving three armies on the island lol. I'm willing to give you some builds, but unless I get centers somewhere else that's pretty much the end of my support for FER simply because I won't have the units to do anything useful.", "I *think* the way this can work out is having me take Holland and Russia take Kiel.", "That's totally reasonable- and I think FER may be falling apart soon if Russia and I can't figure out our differences soon", "*falling apart soon anyway", "Hello! Sorry about the delay. I'm gonna vacate Hol and Kiel", "I'd prefer to keep Denmark", "You can guarantee that you keep it if you move there", "Wow, Russia was not supposed to go to North Sea", "I think your chances of survival are best if you get Russia and I to fight right now: so even though 3 armies is a great defensive position, I might consider keeping Edi to fan the flames", "I legitimately thought you would bounce me from Denmark (the irony that the only reason you have this choice is due to losses from Russia and I is not lost on me)", "No worries.", "So out of curiosity... are you gonna try to take my home centers or can I just ride this one out?", "I'm not going to try to take your home centers unless I can solo, which is seeming more and more unlikely with builds that indicate a coalition forming against me", "If it's any consolation you don't have to worry about my participation in a coalition LMAO", "If you're interested in getting me out of the channel, I'm moving Channel to North Sea right now if Edinburgh is free to support that move?", "Why do you need that? You have a fleet in NTH don't you?", "I don't *need* it per se, but I plan to leave the North Sea and there is a good chance that Russia may choose to bounce it out with Norwegian Sea.", "Alright sounds good", "Do you want support to Norwegian Sea?", "Supporting NTH?", "NTH would support Edi to Norwegian Sea", "Nah I'm content to chill in Edi but I'll support you into NWG if you wanna hit that fleet", "Sure", "Are you and Russia gonna work it out?", "Unfortunately not.", "Instead of holding with all your units, you could always do a \"Yorkshire Pudding\" by sending all of your units to Yorkshire", "Oh that's true if I'm gonna sit on this island I'm gonna have a good time while I do it", "Real talk am I deserving of Turkey's flame/", "I don't see what else I could've done with 3 builds", "Turkey is just upset over the game I think", "If you were going to attack me the time to do it would have been building 2 fleets instead of 2 armies. But the context of that turn was me agreeing to move out of English Channel and attack Italy", "After that you had a significant unit disadvantage", "We should probably move this conversation away

Have you heard from anyone yet?", "I don't have much info right now unfortunately. Our countries definitely compliment eachother through", "I've heard from Russia and it seemed like he was a solid player and would probably be a good ally for you. The Russia Turkey alliance is one of the strongest on the board. As France it would be a natural for me to help you with that as I am on the other side of the board", "Also, sorry for the weird communication times. I've been in and out since it was a super busy day today and actually missed some of your questions. I'd love to share as much info on our neighbors and I've heard from almost everyone", "No problem at all! On that note, It sounds like Italy may be headed your way. Of course I can't be sure but that's what he indicated. Whether that's short or mid term I can't be sure.", "Thanks for the heads up- I appreciate it. Any more ideas about your own plans in the East?", "Any new updates on what is going on now that moves have resolved?", "Pretty sure Austria and Russia and maybe even Italy are all planning to Roast Turkey. Given Germany is gifting Sweden and England doesn't look like putting up any resistance in the North to Russia either, I think the likelihood of a runaway Russia is rising by the minute \ud83d\ude42", "A runaway Russia would not be good for me. Not sure how much I can help though since I'm on the other side of the board. Maybe you can convince Italy to help you against Austria by offering them Greece", "Nice work getting Austria on your side", "Russia seems to be well defended but not too strong, so I don't know how much more you stand to gain from attacking Russia. My honest opinion is that you stand more to gain from stabbing Austrua", "(Than continuing to attack Russia)", "Thanks yeah its still definitely very dicey down here but hoping to secure my homelands at least. Nice one nabbing Munich. Not exactly a common goal to achieve in 1901!", "Any preferences on who you want to work with? It might affect some of my decisions here.", "There is zero chance I keep Munich, so really what it does is slow down Germany temporarily from running everyone over with 3 builss", "Russia and Austria could potentially be attacking you since Rumania is an easy picking. Hopefully one of them is a strong ally?", "Actually, maybe not, since I think Russia is helping me against Germany by moving to Silesia", "Looks like I had bad information, which is too bad since I will be losing Munich", "Are you still working with Austria? Your moves were especially clever so it looks like you will take Sevastopol, but it seems like you may have a tough time expanding much further than that. You might stall out.", "Yes maybe but there is still options for work g with Austria. Shame about Munich but I think you're still in a pretty good position. Germany looks to be in a bit of trouble with both you and England threatening", "Its a position with next to no growth potential unfortunately. We'll see what happens. It seems that both Austria and Russia are willing to work with you", "Do you have any Intel on Germany or England?", "Do you have any Intel on Germany or England?", "What are you building?", "Sorry for my lack of communication - been busy here. I'm leaning towards a fleet at this stage. I don't have anything on England and Germany - Germany says they are tied up and suggest I go after Russia - both things are not going to enlighten anyone who is looking at the board right now. He doesn't seem particularly concerned with his situation but I may be reading too much into that. Looks pretty scary for him right now with Russia on his doorstep as well as you and England circling.", "Interesting to see your progress in positioning against Italy. At some point, maybe we can start talking about what the long term on that front looks like?", "I wonder if it makes sense for you to actually work with Italy here to stab Austria.", "I can't really see it. If you want, hit tys again this year and I can support you into tun next year in return", "I marked that as a lie because I think you CAN see it. You and Italy could have stabbed Austria for 3 supply centers last turn.", "What I can see is a good relationship between you and Italy, a wintergreen from the beginning and a spot for me as the third wheel in that. Not the most amazing opportunity but maybe I'm missing something", "That's the case if you're trying to top the board, but the way we're paid it doesn't matter if you have 17 supply centers or 1", "It's not a ton of difference in terms of payment honestly. But if you can eliminate somebody without being eliminated yourself, I'd say that you'd be better off (in general)", "I'm in it for the competition and to win.", "But, think about all the things you could buy with $2 Amazon credit \ud83e\udd23!", "Lol good point! I should reassess my priorities \ud83d\ude2c", "Well whats your plans now - North or East? If you want to go East, I'm here.", "...to help", "I think I might be mostly positioning myself for the future to remain flexible", "How about you? Are you still committed to playing the slow grind with Austria? I'm sure you are already aware of this, but we do end the game in winter of 1910.", "Yup just going to grind it out. Russia wants to get me. That's his sole mission in this game. Attacking Austria isnt going to help defend against them.", "Looks like Austria was convinced to work with Russia? I wonder if your plan is to try and make up with Austria or not.", "The German NMR gifting the west annd Russia centers and now Englands moves have written this game off in my opinion.", "I get where you are coming from, but I hope you stick it out. I think you've forgotten that your loyal ally France has come to save the day!", "So, what are your plans now? I don't want to fight you over the Ionian", "Just going through the motions - happy to do whatever you like really - just let me know", "However, one thing I would ask is that you hit NAP with ROM. I just want to survive, so I need to keep Austria out of ADR. Otherwise, my units are at your service \ud83d\ude42 Just don't let Russia win please.", "Sounds good. I will definitely be keeping an eye on Russia", "Austria is already in the Adriatic Sea unfortunately though", "Sorry I meant the ION", "So do you think I'm allied with Italy or something? You basically have done the opposite to everything I've asked in relation them which is... strange. You'd have had nap now if you followed through.", "You are obviously not allied with Italy. I don't want you to feel like you are being ignored- but ultimately I decided to make the moves that I thought would be best to help me hold onto what I currently have of Italy. A better way for me to handle things would have been to give you a heads up beforehand (for which I apologize). That being said, we would be having a different conversation had I made an explicit commitment towards moving to Naples. And in terms of results, I think you are actually the greatest beneficiary of the moves from last spring, so there is also that \ud83d\ude02 .", "If you would like, I can support Albania to Trieste", "I have to defend Greece but thanks", "Still there?", "Nice work on the build by the way.", "I agree that you should defend Greece. Any thoughts on what you want to do about your fleet in Tunis though? Maybe we can organize a swap for Naples?", "Sounds fair to me", "And btw my message about Greece was sent last season but I forgot to give it the thumbs up so it didn't go through.", "I messed that season up though - had to just let Russia into Sev with his army so he couldn't build there and I could've taken the Black Sea", "Looks like Russia failed to build in Sev anyway \ud83d\ude42. What's your relationship with Austria?", "That is handy. Pretty good overall although he's been quiet lately. He stabbed me but then Russia immediately attacked him so I'm sure we can work something out.", "He's angry at me- so not sure how helpful he will be against Russia. I bet Austria will be taking supply centers from me this turn.", "Nice moves-except for the Austrian hold in Budapest, which means that Rumania was not taken :(", "I'm supporting your fleet in Tyrhenian to Naples as per our earlier agreement to swap Tunis for Naples.", "Any idea what the deal is regarding Russia/Austria? I imagine that Austria and Russia plan to take a couple dots off of me this turn", "I think the point where I stop making any progress is coming up very soon, so I'd love to start talking about ways this plays out to a draw", "thoughts? The bot was down for a short bit", "Are you moving to Naples?", "Yes, and thanks for the support into it", "sorry, been out for a bit", "Sounds good. No worries", "I was floating the idea of a 3 way draw between you, Russia, and I, since it would make sense if we pulled it off correctly.", "Up to you guys really. I will probably just try and be a pain for whoever is getting close to the solo by helping the other. I would therefore be happy to take the draw instead.", "Looks like you should be able to take it out anyway though. Russia has been playing some sub-par moves so the solo is there for you to take.", "With the English freebies its pretty much done.", "There's no solo in sight right now", "Probably makes sense to build an army for you I would think. We're stalemated in the Mediterranean anyway", "I'm building an army in Marseilles for example", "What do you mean there's no solo in sight? lol you're on 15 and there are three free centres in England... I might not be paying much attention to this game but I'd have to be blind and dumb not to see that. Even if there weren't freebies there you could get them elsewhere. You'd have to try harder not to solo from here haha", "Sure, it's definitely possible. That being said, I also think it would be inconvenient to take English supply Centers due to the density of those units", "Regarding the three way, the best way to do it would probably be to force Austria off the map this turn. Maybe Bulgaria-Serbia with support from Rumania while Russia supports Galicia to Budapest?", "The only issue would be a retreat to Greece or Albania, so it might be worthwhile to bounce in Albania with Greece and Ion to prevent any retreats", "Interesting, I didn't mean to take Naples- I figured you might cut the Tyrhenian Sea's support. I'll move out if we can call a truce in Trieste?", "Interesting choice to move to Albania as it means that Turkey can retreat to Greece", "*Austria can retreat to Greece", "This game is over, spending more than 2 minutes per season is a waste of time. I'm glad you found the moves interesting though! I cant stop laughing at \"I didn't mean to take Naples\". In my experience, the best way not to take something is to not attack it. That's just what I've found but I guess you've got other methods of not taking something haha, of course you meant to take Naples and of course we both know that this game has been over for a few seasons. It's all the same at this point. Good game, well played. If you're trying to rack up lies with me I wouldn't bother. I have to conclude that that's the only point for all of them the last few seasons or is it just for fun? If its just for fun, carry on, I dont mind. If its for the successful lie counter, Russia is a better option for that I think?", "Well. I was trying to get you to not take Trieste in the fall. I can support it to hold, but I suspect that if you and Russia are coordinating, Vienna would cut Tyrolia's support."], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, false, true, true, true, true, false, true,
