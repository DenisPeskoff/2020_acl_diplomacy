{"messages": ["Good afternoon to our friends in the south, just sending this message to open a channel for future relations when ever they need to happen, and to say 'howdy and have a good game' to you.", "Of course! I thank you very much. The future of the Kaissereich and its effect on my neighbors will be very important to me, so tell me if you want help to dissuade attack.", "Well, should the French turn out to be a thorn in my side I would greatly appreciate the aid", "Greetings from new Italy!", "Would just like to reiterate that Italy would likely take an opportunistic stance towards France - their defensive position is strong enough that I won't attack them proactively, but if they are locked into a conflict with you I might stab them", "So in that sense Italy is broadly friendly to your interests - if you and France are allied I will leave you alone, but if France is your enemy I could potentially help you to break a stalemate", "But what I'd need in exchange is for you to keep me posted on developments in the west. Are you leaning towards working with England, or France?", "It seems for the moment that both are cooperative, but I'm likely to side with the French from the outset barring difficulties with them. I'll keep you posted, same relationship as previously established. In any case, friendship with the French is not very likely to last past England's demise so I'll definitely need the help then. Thank!", "Makes sense. Hopefully I'll be on the winning side of a conflict against Turkey or Austria by then, which should put us in position to squeeze France", "I'd greatly prefer you end up on Austria's side of that conflict all things considered, but if things don't go his way I wouldn't blame you for siding against them.", "Definitely understandable. But since Italy starts off as one of the weaker countries, I basically need to play a little opportunistically", "The elephant in the room is Russia - would you have any insight on what they're planning?", "Unfortunately we only talked very briefly about staying out of each other's ways.", "Haha didn't try to hold Sweden hostage to get him to play nice with Austria? That's my usual go-to as Germany lol", "Have you talked more with Austria? I must admit to being concerned about you moving to Tyrolia in their defense", "Since that would allow the two of you to launch a pretty credible attack on Venetia", "As Germany I generally play somewhat more careful, get them to just promise not to be an enemy until the Western Triple becomes a Western Double. As far as Austria goes, we're allied, hence my preference for Turkey being your foe rather than them. I've no intent of turning South though, not by any means. Don't have the pieces for that.", "Yeah, fair enough. I'm planning on a pretty standard opening to Ionian Sea, aiming to convoy to Tunis and with a bounce in Austria", "It's a pretty noncommittal move, so will wait and see how things play out", "But I'm sure nobody will miss the fact that it sets me up for the Lepanto if the cards fall that wau", "Well the Lepanto setup is generally considered Italy's best opener, regardless of whether they trust Austria, hard to argue with a classic.", "It's looking like the Russians and the Turks are trying a Juggernaut.", "If they do that, we desperately need to be strongly allied with the Austrians, otherwise they'll roll us over, hard.", "I am also concerned about the Juggernaut, which pushes me towards you and Austria's camp", "It seems France and England are at a loggerhead already, so if you side with England it might be an opportunity for me as well", "Our interests are aligned in both sides of the map, so let's just coordinate closely", "I'd be more comfortable committing both fleets east to support Austria against Turkey if I knew you were going to Burgundy (which makes it harder for France to convoy to Tuscany)", "France's F Marseille is a major headache for me", "What say you?", "France is definitely going to be a thorn in your side, unfortunately I can neither afford to attack them right now nor likely convince them to not attack you, they're more powerful than I am and I've already pissed off two of my three potentially unfriendly neighbors.", "The Balkan Front is pretty secure for you two though, you can at least hold and with some tricky maneuvering, very easily begin advancing through the Turks.", "Understood. Know that Austria and Italy are not going to be able to hold out against Russia and Turkey", "If you want to prevent a juggernaut, we will need whatever help from you we can get", "Well, as I'm sure you've noticed, I've mobilized for the task.", "I've talked to the French to try and get them off your back, but they're dedicated to seeing you off. They told me to tell you that they plan to attack Piedmont with support, which indicates that they're probably planning a convoy to Tuscany. You can't let that happen.", "Well, it seems the attack on Piedmont with support was genuine, which seems like a very poor decision by the French", "Yeah, maybe they predicted that you'd think they were lying to me? Regardless, bad move on their part in any case, especially since you have a build.", "Good news for you though. A distracted France is still more than enough firepower to get you through England, and it makes it easy for you to stab them after", "I don't know whether you deliberately leaked me that intel thinking I would disbelieve it and go to Tuscany, but no hard feeling if so", "That's jsut well played", "It certainly does, I wish they'd let you get on with destroying the Turks so you could focus fire on them when it's needed but still. And I gave you that information because I genuinely thought that their objective would be to get you to expect what they told me to tell you so they could do something else. Was worried that they'd do the convoy because that would be devastating for you.", "Haha honestly that risk was very top of mind for me, since I attempted the same convoy as France in the previous game", "So would likely have made the risk averse move to avoid the convoy even without the warning", "Yeah, it's a real power-move as the French to pull off that convoy.", "Well, it didn't work for me either", "Well, experienced Italys generally see it coming.", "Indeed.", "I'm trying to do damage control with the Austrians. It was incredibly damaging for them to do that and I can't imagine why they've decided to side with the Turks rather than you. If it doesn't work out, I'm going to go nuclear and split them lengthways with the Turks.", "I was taken very surprised in large part because I didn't see - and still don't see - what they stand to gain", "And if they really stand to gain ground, why not make a play for Venice?", "No idea, the y apparently aren't interested in working with you anymore. I'm quite frankly pulling my hair over this, it's the worst possible move.", "I find myself very confused by it as well, which is part of why I am not quite sure how to respond", "Would you be willing to coordinate against A Tyrolia? I'd be happy to support A Munich in", "I'm afraid that if I do that, my current position could quickly become untenable. I'm worried that the Austrians are planning something funky.", "Alright, so, I realize that this is a little bit late, but now that the Austrians are embroiled with the Turks, I am moving against the French. I'm trying to convince the Austrians that its in their best interests to join back with you, but I would understand if you might resent him or both of us for our failure to consistently side with you.", "You stabbing the French is already a massive lifeline to me. I could not in good conscious ask you to do more", "I will listen to what Austria has to say, and keep you updated on that front. I do not really trust them, but I may still be willing to work with them against the Turks if they say the right things", "I'm moving on the French this next season, hopefully they'll pull back to face me and you and the British will be able to surge back against them.", "I'm pleasantly surprised that you're so willing to work with England as well", "In that case i'll play defensively but try to set myself up for a counteroffensive", "Well the English are a little miffed that I didn't move last season, but still, I see no reason not to work with them for the time being.", "Yeah, agreed. The English are too desperate to turn down your support", "Conversely, you have a free walk into Paris right now", "Since France has only fleets", "A Mun - Bur and then to Paris is guarrenteed to succeed as long as you can cover a potential stab on Mun, which you could easily do with A Ber", "And then A Hol-Bel isn't quite as foolproof, but is pretty safe as well", "Especially if you support yourself into NTH and move Kie - Hol", "If you're wondering who convinced the French to make it a fleet, you need go no further", "Well, sounds like things are in good shape!", "Hopefully the French are sufficiently distracted that you can launch a counter attack.", "Yeah, I'll make the most of this", "The Austrians wouldn't happen to be talking about me, would they?", "I haven't heard anything from them", "Well, at the very least that's good. I'm worried about them potentially deciding that they want Warsaw, despite the fact that I'm on the right side of a stalemate line where they'd only get 1 supply center if they attacked.", "Are you coordinating with the Turks? I think that for the time being that would be a good idea.", "Yeah, am trying to do so", "Not to be needy or anything, but I would greatly appreciate a hard move for Venice this next year.", "I will make a play for Venice this Fall", "If I was in Austria's shoes, I would do a self bounce of F Ven - Tri, A Ser - Tri", "So I plan to do F Alb S F Ven - Tri, A Apu - Ven", "Odds of succeeding in this improve dramatically if also support with A Tyr S A Apu - Ven - would you be willing to do so?", "Gas and Bur likely cannot take Mar anyways, so in my view you would be better off using:\nA Par & A Pic S A Gas - Bre\nF NTH S F Bel - ENG\nA Bur - Mun", "This would be a near-guarantee that you take Brest and would occupy F ENG as a consolation prize in the only outcome where you didn't, while still covering Munich", "My only problem with that plan is that it risks losing Burgundy if the French pull a fast one and go for Silesia instead, while moving Marseilles into Burgundy.", "That's a valid point. My view is that A Mar - Bur is unlikely but A Boh - Sil is a real risk", "If you want to keep France out of Bohemia, A Gal is the only unit you have that can do so", "Which might be a better investment that using it to try and snipe Bud", "Although actually, if you hit Vienna and France has two disbands, they may struggle to keep up the pressure around Silesia", "That's true, I don't know if I want to take my chances with that though.", "I'll probably move into Vienna, but I'm not sure I can afford to move out of Burgundy.", "Understood, So then you would use A Gal to cover Warsaw, A Bur to cover Munich, and then try to snipe Vienna with A Tyr?", "Correct"], "sender_labels": [true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true,

And yes I would like peace on our front, I could have a three front war at any time so it would be great if you and I did not fight. Where would you expand to then?", "I will be moving into Ven with Tri (traditional Austrian opening) and fully understand that you would go Ven to Tri as a response so that we bounce. If you can come up with a good alternative then I am fine with that but I don\u2019t see one.", "I am perfectly comfortable with a Ven-Tri bounce, so no need for further discussion on that point. Would like to suggest that we demilitarize Tyrolia, at least for year one as well", "Would like to get your thoughts on your other moves? Is A Budapest going to Serbia, and is A Vienna going to Galicia or allowing Russia in?", "Okay the bounce sounds good. And I would love to demilitarize Tyr for this year and we can talk about it again then", "Why do you need my moves?", "I think in general it pays to know as much as possible about what everyone is doing. Even if they lie, it helps you get an early picture on who is trustworthy :p", "But I think the Austria Italy relationship is bigger than that", "Austria and Italy are two countries which can easily fall into a mutually destructive war until they both get eaten by Turkey", "But it's also very hard for us to trust each other, since it's so easy to stab. That's a big part of what makes these two countries so challenging for a lot of players, right?", "In that sense, it helps for us to be open with each other. It's a very different game for me if Russia gets into Galicia early, putting them and Turkey in place to roll the map, compared to if you and Turkey push Russia out of Rumania in year one", "In that context, I'm pretty comfortable telling you that I don't plan to get greedy in year 1 - as long as I can secure Tunisia while keeping a secure defensive position, I'm happy", "I 100% do not want to fight you. I agree that Austria Italy is a war that often happens but never really works out for either side. We would just stagnate until russia or turkey or both took us out.", "On that note I have heard rumors that turkey and Russia are gonna go for a juggernaut. If that is the case I\u2019d assume you would help me slow them down.", "Probably don\u2019t need to point this out but you allying with turkey would eventually lead to him attacking you unless you stabbed him first", "Definitely agree that, assuming we can trust each other, the Austria-Italy alliance tends to be more stable than the Austria-Turkey one", "Turkey and Russia bounced in the Black Sea, but that proves little since Juggernaut allies often go for that anyways", "Russia has committed pretty hard to the south, which is mildly concerning for both of us. In the event that the Juggernaut materializes however, my sense is that Germany would also be willing to support us", "I guess for this year, suggest that we do the Ven-Tri bounce again. I would suggest to keep Turkey out of Greece and use Vienna to defend against Russia.", "I will convoy A Apulia to Tunisia", "All sounds good to me", "Have you talked to turkey much?", "Not a whole lot. Their move to the Black Sea was news to me", "So turkey went back on their deal with me and tried to let russia get rum while they snuck into Gre. Juggernaut confirmed", "I\u2019d like to propose that you and I go full alliance", "I'm game for the Lepanto, and it seems Germany is on board as well", "What does that look like in practice? Germany builds in Berlin, you in Budapest", "And then hit Rumania in Spring?", "Not positive what I would do yet but something along those lines. You would definitely build a fleet in Nap and then move ION to EAS", "France and Turkey are trying to get me to attack you, obviously I will not do that", "With the build in Marseilles, France's goals are quite transparent", "Turkey will likely bounce me in EAS. Would you be willing to support me into Greece (via convoy)?", "From there, I can support you into Bulgaria", "I\u2019m willing to debate it but I had a different view on this turn. I figured he would bounce you in EAS but what if you went for AEG instead? Unless you\u2019re worried about over extending yourself due to France. Because I trust you enough at this point to move Tri to Alb and then we will definitely be able to get Gre in the fall.", "Which makes going to AEG/EAS a bit of an overstretch", "If we can get Germany on board I'd feel a lot more comfortable with committing east", "Sorry, some connection issues on my end so messages sent out of order", "But basically I'm concerned about France's F Marseille, so a little nervous about committing both fleets east", "But I think having Germany attack France would ease that", "So in theory if we could not get germany to attack France, what kind of attack would you be comfortable with us making", "In which case convoying onto Greece is the best use of the fleet and army I'd have available", "Okay I will support that, can you move out of Ven?", "So I am in a slightly sticky situation but I think I can get out of it. If I support you holding in Gre then would you move that fleet into EAS?", "Also Germany and France are allied, however Germany is also willing to help us out", "Let me know what you\u2019re thinking", "Germany and France allying is not ideal for me, but I feel confident in observing that Turkey and Russia are allied as well", "So desperate times call for desperate measures - may need to do what needs to be done to stop the juggernaut", "Would appreciate you helping me to hold in Greece, and we'll need whatever help from Germany that we can get", "I can still support A Serbia - Buglaria as well, if that helps", "Look at the moves from last turn, turkey tried to support me attacking Russia. Why do you think they are still allied?", "To put it simply, I missed that. I find Backstabbr's map interface hard to read, and didn't see it in the list of orders", "Which I will look at more carefully going forward", "I gotcha, so you are clearly going after Turkey right now but have to deal with France. What\u2019re you thinking in regards to that whole situation. Because I have to figure out whether or not I can use turkey as a short term ally vs Russia", "However I view you as my most important ally which is why I\u2019m asking you about all this", "I have moved against Turkey, but I am willing to back down to focus on France", "If you would rather coordinate with Turkey against Russia, I'm open to the idea of a southern triple as Turkey suggested", "I mean turkey knows that you and I are allied so I think that if you attack him then he will attack me. I don\u2019t really wanna fight him and russia at the same time", "Do you think you can gain supply centers vs France? I get that you need to expand somewhere", "What\u2019re you thinking for this season", "I most likely can't gain a supply center this year, but I should be able to gain ground as long as neither you nor Turkey stab me", "My thinking is that I'll go with the conservative option", "Which is:\n F TYS S F Rome - Tus\nA Tus - Ven", "And then withdraw F EAS - ION", "Should put me in position to push through WES starting fall while covering all my bases defeinsively", "That all seems logical", "What are you thinking? F Alb S A Gre H would be appreciated in my perspective", "Neither of us have a good reason to stab you, we gotta focus on russia", "Yeah, naturally.

Here's my idea, and take it or leave it ... but I suggest that Italy keep rotating his fleets out (maybe move towards WES and TUN) while Austria backfills ION.  Italy builds a fleet in ROM and Austria can convoy Greece into NAP in the Spring.  Now Italy's got three fleets in play while France is trying to land a unit on England.

For that reason he wants me to cut support in Sev so that he can take Rum or attack Mos to either take that or bounce it.

We might even be able to do a transfer this spring", "Though if you told  the Italians that you were moving on Bulgaria they might be understandably miffed to have missed that opportunity.", "That would be really nice, I could really use the units.", "No I didn\u2019t tell them that", "Ill be able to use my new one to push back russia", "Well pushing back Russia isn't really the concern anymore, they're going to have to disband, the real concern now needs to be curbing the Turks before they gain enough momentum on you two.", "The Russians are all kinds of out of position to boot.", "Yeah plus they have zero allies", "Unless you count the British, but they made no attempt to help out this time.", "So France is going full split fronts, how\u2019re you feeling about getting through england", "It'll be slow, but as soon as Russia's dispatched properly the British won't be able to stop me hammering through them.", "I\u2019m trying to figure out if I wanna convince Italy to lay off of turkey", "Alright, so Warsaw can support do what it likes, but helping me into Livonia would be pretty ideal.", "Yeah I\u2019ll do that but you need to support War holding then with Sil", "That's the plan", "What do you think russia will do with Gal this turn lol.

I can check again if you'd like, but in any case siding with the Turks is a sucker's bet for you. Once Russia's gone they have nowhere to expand and they're at your back, and siding with them will rapidly erode Italy's willingness to side with you.", "Interested to see if Russia has actually quit", "Same. Turks have yet to respond to me seeing how interested they are in betraying you", "Haven\u2019t talked to me yet either", "Do you think taking Gre was a bad move", "Well, you can count on Italy not being fans of the move.", "Turkey's starting to respond, their biggest question so far is how we would split you, east/west or north/south.", "I personally wouldn't have done it, you need the Italians to keep the French off your border and to help if the Turks decide to take you down, andthe Turks have no reason not to want you dead if the opportunity arises. You don't need them for Russia anymore, so who do you need them for? What do they need you for?

Also, I think England might be desperate lol.", "How goes there?", "Nervous part of the game for me", "Not in love with turkeys army build", "Have you talked with France about their Tyr move", "Yeah, it's an Italy-centric move. They mean you no harm as far as I'm aware.", "They haven't been very talkative since Friday though so it's hard to say.", "I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re responding to the France thing and not the turkey thing", "Yeah, the Turkey thing can really only go one way.", "He says he\u2019s convoying it to Apu, seems legit and if he moves it to Bul instead I will see it coming", "I need to figure out what direction I wanna go now", "Not to sound like a broken clock or anything, but Turkey's got very little option but to fight you at this point, that's a pretty good direction to point yourself.", "Neither of us are in a position for it right now though", "So what are you gonna do, you committed a lot of stuff East that isn\u2019t very useful anymore", "Well, probably going to finish off the Brits, then I'm not sure honestly.", "That\u2019s fair. Do you buy that turkey is moving Con to Apu", "Personally? Not really, but it's possible.", "My only holdup with it is that he could have just built the army in Smy then", "Exactly", "Gonna see if France is willing to talk, will let you know what he says about you", "If he says anything", "He hasn't spoken to me in a while, not sure what's up.", "Yeah I\u2019m gonna at least try and figure out some Italy stuff", "You can take St P but can you hit UKR for me", "Can do. Told you the Turks were no good.", "Glad that I moved against them", "Yeah, things are about to get reeeeal hectic over there. Not sure how much I can help.", "Me either, I\u2019m honestly not sure I can win", "It might be possible if you reconcile with the Italians and help them push off the French.", "It would at the very least become a lot more likely.

You probably won\u2019t be able to solo unless you take out France soon", "No idea, probably some form of draw but it's hard to say who all would be involved at this point.", "And yes, I can do that", "Everything good?", "Yup yup, everything's good over here", "The heck are the Turks up to even?", "Ugh, I feel like a jerk putting the knife in France's back this hard. Feels way worse than what I did to the Turks last time.", "Turkey thought we had an alliance but the last time we talked he said he was attacking Me until we figured it out. We never talked because I was a little in active I didn\u2019t reach out until last night so I had to put in orders against him. He trusted me blindly", "France is bummed, just sent us a mass message to attack you", "Well, I hope that you won't, that would put a damper on things.", "Haha yes it would", "There is no way that I can, no way turkey doesn\u2019t attack me for the rest of the game now", "Yeah you really kinda have to get rid if them if you want to go forward with anything else", "Good to see that Turkey is progressing well! If the French disband in Tyrolia, would you mind if I jump in? I'd like to hasten their demise by denying them Venice,  if possible.", "Denying who Venice", "The French of course", "Gotcha", "Well, moot anyways I suppose. They're staying put it seems. How goes Turkey?", "Eh", "I really haven\u2019t enjoyed this game, austria is my least favorite country", "I like Austria honestly, generally if you lose it's very early, and it requires good communication.", "With any luck, the game will be over soon enough anyways, the French really have no recourse here.", "Soon as you take out the Turks and the Italians we can end it, and the Turks are definitely on the ropes.", "If you had more troops this direction I'd suggest we could work together to displace Tyrolia with one of your armies, but you'd have to cover Trieste and Turkey could easily take advantage of that in the current state.", "Are you saying two way?", "Unless you can think of anyone else who we'd include.", "I thought you would go solo", "Why would I do that?", "Lol because you probably can", "I mean, I probably could have last time too, if I hadn't spent half the game with 6 armies sitting around doing nothing lol", "Fair, well I\u2019d be happy to be included", "Outstanding prediction on that French move, if that wasn't a coincidence.", "Haha thanks, yeah it was a guess", "Now I have to guess right again", "If the Italians were more enthusiastic revanchists this would be easier, I kinda wish you hadn't moved into Ionian, it really spooked them.", "They hate me anyways", "No offense, but that *is* mostly on you.", "Oh of course", "I\u2019m terrible with Austria, I freak out and don\u2019t trust anyone.", "Everyone on the board except you hates me", "Can't imagine why the French would, but apparantly they want to pick fights with you too now.", "For me the problem country is Italy. Can never get the hang of it.", "Tbf I can't even really talk, the British are being extremely uncooperative because of my previous action against them.", "I actually like Italy, as you know I try as hard as I can to ally with Russia. If I can\u2019t get that then usually Turkey will attack Austria with me.", "Yeah, Italy's really one where you have to go with the Russians or get REALLY unorthodox, the generally accepted path is kinda crap.", "Most Italians just start a fight with Austria without reaching out to other people that\u2019s the issue", "I suppose it's another one that requires really good coordination. I can never convince the French it isn't worth it though.", "As Italy?", "These games through the study are the only ones I have ever really played where France goes for Italy. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because players are more experienced here or just a coincidence", "Not sure, I've seen it fairly frequently.", "Usually France is busy freaking out about E/G in my games", "In games I'm in England and France are generally the ones fucking Germany over.", "I always feel like that goes poorly for england", "Depends if France is the kind of fool that doesn't build fleets.", "True", "Would you like me to come down and help expel the French? I can mobilize Munich and Warsaw to the task. It would involve moving into Bohemia and Tyrolia, but drastic times call for drastic measures.", "Yeah I\u2019d appreciate it", "Not a good turn for me I made some bad guesses", "No worries, I'll come down to help out.", "So I just realized that my mind made a goof and Warsaw doesn't border Bohemia. Would you mind terribly if I moved into Galicia to help ensure you can expel the French? From there we can mutually bounce in Budapest while displacing Venice (Assuming that you don't successfully occupy Budapest in Spring). You'll need to hold Budapest on your own power for the first turn though.", "Also, if you retreat to the Adriatic you can take Venice uncontested.", "Yeah do what you need but obviously we will continue to coordinate", "I feel like im screwed", "Well, things could certainly be better all things considered.", "Oh hey, everything went great; situation normal", "Do you think it'd be a good idea for me to temporarily occupy Vienna to deprive the French of the dot? Or would you be uncomfortable with that you think", "I mean it\u2019s not mine right now, go for it", "If I could get in it would be a different story", "Fair enough, just wanted to get your approval first.", "Highly unexpected move from the Turks there, though it does leave them open to an attack through Armenia.", "I'm vacating Vienna for you to move in. I'll be moving to Galicia, and back to Warsaw from there.", "Yeah you have to because of that French unit, he\u2019s annoyingly", "Incredibly. He's sacrificing his ability to hang on to territory in favor of being a thorn in our mutual side.", "Turkey is getting on my nerves. Keeps just yelling at me lol", "He says I\u2019m letting you win, honestly all my chips are on us doing a two way. I can\u2019t stop you so I might as well hope you wanna win together Lol", "I sure would love to, but at this point I'm not sure it's possible, these games are limited to year 10 and that's rapidly approaching. I don't think we can make up the lost ground for you even if they all post four no-orders turns.", "There's basically only two ways for this to finish, four way draw and German victory. I hate to say it and I won't suggest one over the other to you, but I think it should be clear which I'd greatly prefer.", "Ya plus I just messed up", "Yeah, even if this kept going after year ten that would be a terrible setback", "Honesty not quite the best policy on this one eh? In any case I understand.", "Lol I kinda just figured fuck it", "Well, we'll see if you can stop me \ud83d\ude09", "Hahhaa yeah definitely going to", "Definitely going to stop me or definitely going to see?", "Lol we\u2019ll see. I doubt we can stop you at this point", "Gonna be real, I'd give it 50/50 odds, there's only 3 more turns and it could go either way depending on how you four move."], "sender_labels": [true, true,

I'm supporting myself into Sweden and moving on Norway from there; if you want to simplify things we could have you take all of Britain and just transfer Belgium to me (So that we both net 2 from the British, since I'll have Norway), though I would understand why you might be uncomfortable with that.", "I'm really torn over what to do in Italy. I spoke to Austria about going after them together, and they are thinking about it. I could try convoying Mar into Tuscany, with Pie supporting. This is basically the same as just moving Pie into Tuscany, with support from my fleet, except for that if I convoy Mar the support is less likely to be cut(I think there is a higher chance they will cut support to my fleet than cut support/move to Piedmont)", "The Austrians are currently making a whole slew of bad decisions, allying with the Turks is a sucker's bet. I'm not sure what you should do tbh, the Italians aren't talking to me much anymore.", "I suppose we could have me take all of Britain, and have me give you Belgium, but I would ask that as soon as you take Belgium, you move back out. It's definitely an option, but I will have to think about it.", "Oh of course, once I had it I'd get out of there immediately. Trust is the key in transfers like this.", "Take your time, we've got several turns until it needs settling, and several days till the next turn.", "I could move Piedmont to Tyr, it's a great place to be. Not sure if I would get in though.", "Tyr is one of those spots where everyone around gets nervous when you're there.", "Yep, Austria wouldn't like that.", "Good tactical utility though, if you want to strongarm into Venice.", "I feel like we could very well end up with a standoff between me and you, and turkey and austria. I'm kinda trying to brew unrest over there, spreading rumours and such.", "I have been desperately attempting to convince the Austrians that they're better off with me but it hasn't  been working.", "Why didn't you want me supporting you? My move into Lon was already garunteed.", "Whatever", "I was thinking either the British or Russians would make a play for Sweden, wanted the support to ensure the move. In any case we should have an easy time moving forward.", "In any case we're both making pretty good gains.", "I'll be building in Munich, just so I don't catch you by surprise with that. Want to be able to move in as fast as possible on the Austrians when we go for it.", "What do you think the next move should be?", "Could you support Bel to Nth?", "Absolutely. My fleet in Denmark wouldn't be doing anything otherwise. Are you moving in with Piedmont or Tyrolia? Because if it's not Tyrolia I can support that to stay put, just in case the Austrians get antsy.", "I'm having Tyrolia support piedmont in. I will definitly get it unless for some reason the austrians support italy, which would be wierd.", "Thanks for supporting Bel", "Feel free to support Tyr, but don't feel pressure to do so if you have a better move in mind", "I'm waiting to have St. Petersburg to make a move on the Austrians, Munich has nothing to do for the moment except to support Tyrolia.", "Everything worked out great.", "And it looks like the Turks and Austrians are at each others throats now.", "The Brits are trying really hard to get me to throw myself against you. I mean reeeeeally hard.", "lol. All I can say is that I hope you don't, since we have this game in the bag", "You could use that. Tell them you will stab me, and tell them my moves(but false) so that I can get in more easily", "I can probably jump into Edinburgh via the Norwegian sea this next year, no need for the Belgium transfer.", "LOL italy just messaged me and said that \"Austria's build in Trieste cannot be anything but a play for Venice\" and then \"I am willing to concede it to you if you cooperate elsewhere\", so I guess they don't understand I already have it. They sure are getting desperate.", "Think I should play along, or just tell them about what \"concede\" really means, and that you can't concede something if your opponent controls it and you have no chance of getting it back.", "Also, what do you think I should do for builds? A fleet in Brest or an army in Paris?", "Go ahead, play along lol, should be interesting. If I were you I'd build fleets, the enemy from here on out is one on the seas almost exclusively.", "k, what do you think about builds?", "Would you be ok with me building army in paris? I would send it over to the south east prob", "Not sure, at least one army, might build a navy even though I won't have much use for it anymore.", "You can if you want, but I think a Navy would do a lot to forcing the Mediterranean open faster. Italy's a huge traffic jam for armies.", "Do you still want belgium? At this point our borders are like, super demiliterized, which is pretty nice, but at this point I do trust you, if you want to have it. If you want an center it would prob be better for you to have belgium than enland. Or do you even want a center, since you already have 1 more than me.", "Well, I certainly wouldn't say no, you'll definitely have an easier time taking the Italians than I will bleeding anything from the Austrians.", "Whoa, didn't realize we were so close to adjudication. What are you thinking for moves?", "I don't need support from you anywhere this turn. All my units will be making moves at englands centers/taking the med/taking italy", "All I can say is that I REALLY hope you don't betray me, since you have some units looking like they could just walk into my supply centers. We have such a good run going right now, as long as you don't betray me we can definitly get a two-way draw", "I think I'm gonna move on the Austrians, take them out while they're distracted with the Turks.", "England and Italy both are truly desperate to get me to turn on you, and even the Austrians have thrown some urgings in lol", "lol yes, the Austrians hate me for staying in Triest when I told them I would move, Italy has been desperatly begging for DMZ, and England is obviously done.", "Right, and Austria can't possibly take me and Turkey at the same time", "As long as we keep austria and turkey fighting, you can run them down by land and I can apply presure with fleets", "Yeah, I'm playing both sides to keep them at each other's throats.", "great", "For the record I really hate doing crap like this but I told myself right at the start that I needed to gussy up and go for a solo for once in my life. I love this game but ironically hate the deception aspect >.>\n\nIn any case it's nothing personal and you were super cool to work with", "Tbh I was pretty sure you would do that, but (for once) I wanted to trust somebody in this game bc I've been known to backstab people like crazy. Your all good, Imma put up a fight though and try to stop you \ud83d\ude09", "You were cool to work with to", "Good luck. We did have the two way draw in the bag though", "Wow, you really are pouring units into my hometown. Basically leaving Austria and turkey alone, huh", "I know we did, and to be honest I've been super wishy washy about actually going through with this because of that. I almost did it last turn. I still feel like a jerk doing it.", "And yeah, as long as they're at each other's throats they aren't too much threat, unless you pull some silver tongue on them to get a real coalition of the willing going", "Silver toung it is. It's going to be pretty great if I can get them to organize then we can actually win against you and that would be cool. Well see", "That would be exceptionally interesting! I wouldn't have a lot of chance to shore up that flank, it'dbe a fair and square win. In any case, good luck, and sorry about this, again.", "Your good, I (almost definitly) would have done the same.", "I normally don't, just because I feel like actually being trustworthy most of the time generally improves the game culture. Or maybe I'm just soft and making excuses, hard to say lol", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Well this next turn is going to be weird as hell, however it turns out.", "An outstanding move on your part by the way, the Italians and British are not being as enthusiastic of Revanchists as I was hoping.", "What do you mean outstanding move?", "as in which one \ud83d\ude0f", "The one where you

Instead, it's an FG - which is just as bad for you guys, since Germany is already into Russia.  Here's my idea, and take it or leave it ... but I suggest that he keep rotating his fleets out (maybe move towards WES and TUN) while you backfill ION.  He builds a fleet in ROM and you convoy him into NAP in the Spring.  Now he's got three fleets in play while France is trying to land a unit on England.  Meanwhile, you move your army out of SER and towards Munich and I move BUL/RUM north into SEV, MOS, and WAR.

And where is he going to go next?", "And when you say good friend ... what supply centers did he help you into?  \ud83d\ude42", "Totally understandable, just has been giving good information and stuff.

Either on the computer or on my phone.", "Okay I\u2019m reading your proposal again and are you saying you would get all of russia?", "I now realize what I wrote, but I do need an outlet.

Usually you score your best three results.  There are a few different scoring systems, but generally speaking - if you get good results, you'll do well.", "Seems fun, how do the negotiations go? Like do you pull people aside", "yes, usually it's in a big room - like a hotel ballroom or dormitory basement", "and there's 3-5 boards going on simultaneously", "so, there's about 10-30 conversations going simultaneously.", "Okay so people know who you\u2019re talking to, that is one thing I like about this is like I could be talking to russia and you wouldn\u2019t know it", "Obviously I\u2019m not in this case", "Or maybe you are ....", "Hahahaha", "By the way, if Serbia isn't moving, can it support CON-RUM?", "It\u2019s moving", "May I ask where?", "Bud", "I'll trust you on this one.", "Italy has gotten himself way out of position. I know you like him, but ... he\u2019s not taking advantage of his opportunity against France and is wide open to attack by us. You could go to Greece and I could go to Rumania and we\u2019d have peace. (I\u2019d have to hold for a turn, so that he doesn\u2019t retreat to Bulgaria).", "Yeah let\u2019s look at the builds first", "I\u2019m also a little frustrated with him because he hasn\u2019t replied to a single one of my messages in days (not that I\u2019m overloading him, but this needs to be a two way conversation - I mean, that\u2019s what we\u2019re being compensated for!).", "Yeah he hasn\u2019t chatted a ton with me either", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "you around?  I'm weighing my build options.", "any thoughts?  Fleet versus Army?", "Alright. We doing this?", "My bad, didn\u2019t see the notifications", "So obviously you\u2019re gonna kick Italy out of your area, are you gonna take Sev this turn?", "Well, I\u2019d like to coordinate my move with you. Are you taking Greece? He\u2019d be down to one Army and since he doesn\u2019t seem interested in defending his dots from France, you and I might as well go after them.", "Honestly I have to decide how much I trust you vs how much faith I have in him. Because at this point in the game I still need an ally.", "I\u2019d like for you to take Sev, it we need russia to lose more units so that we can finish him before germany is too strong.", "I feel like despite our rocky start you and I have communicated enough that we can declare a full alliance though", "Regarding Sev, I\u2019d like to take it this year. Maybe in the Fall?", "I think we can definitely partner up and work together to both our benefit. I also don\u2019t think it will be particularly difficult to separate our forces. I only have two armies, so I\u2019m not much of a threat to you and you only have one fleet - so I\u2019m not worried about you coming after me by yourself. The wild card in all of this is Italy, and he\u2019s only got one fleet over by me and a French unit in Piedmont.", "Right now I have Bulgaria supporting Serbia into Greece. I\u2019ll rotate up the coast towards Sevastopol in the Fall and we\u2019ll convoy you onto the boot as soon as possible. I mean ... that\u2019s a strong position for you.", "If we were to follow this sort of path where do you see your expansion going? You can get Sev, Tun, and Nap, then what", "Also I don\u2019t need your support into Gre, I would rather you took Sev this turn", "Expansion: maybe mos and STP? I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re going to head west towards Germany in this scenario. Otherwise, this is only a 10 year game, I don\u2019t have grand designs on a solo victory or anything.", "Ok. I will hold in Bulgaria so that Italy can\u2019t retreat there. And I\u2019ll take out Sev. You\u2019re not dislodging Galicia, are you? I\u2019m worried about him retreating to Rumania.", "Sounds good, I am not dislodging", "OK.", "I know you're choosing between working with Italy and working with me.  The path I'm offering to you allows you to control your own growth and depend on yourself for gains - and making it so that our border is unit-less.  The path of working with Italy also allows you to grow, but you'll be depending on someone else for help after the initial gain and you'll have to dedicate units to the balkans until I'm fully eliminated from the game.   Both are legitimate choices, but I think my offer is superior based on merit.  I've demonstrated that I'm a reliable partner, that I make solid moves and do what I say.", "Yeah I gotcha, I just hate playing as austria and don\u2019t have a lot of successful experience. Often due to Turkey. That and the beginning of this game has made me cautious.", "But Italy\u2019s attack on you is uncoordinated with me and not really going anywhere and it\u2019s hard to work with that", "I\u2019m curious what your plan is. You have a lot of armies on my border.", "Yeah I gotta move those, I\u2019m sorry I was just playing cautious. Hopefully Russia has actually quit that would make things much easier. I will definitely have to go cover Tri because Italy is in Ven and pissed at me", "I\u2019m moving EMS-ION. Can you support it in with Greece?", "(EAS)", "Yes", "Will you support me into a\u00f1os", "Mos", "I was gonna self bounce in Rumania", "Is Germany kicking you out of Warsaw?", "No but we\u2019re trying to transfer it, it was a condition of me getting it first", "I can\u2019t this year. He\u2019s got that pesky A Galicia", "Okay it\u2019s all good", "Hey, I wanted to say - is it something you need to prevent the loss of a center? Because if Germany is going to start trying to take dots off of you, you need help into Moscow more than I need to guarantee I don\u2019t lose Rumania. In fact, I can just cover Rum with Bulgaria. You\u2019re not going to stab me for one dot, I certainly hope.", "I am not, yeah I was gonna make that argument but wait until we got closer to when moves were due", "And yes that would help guarantee that I don\u2019t lose one", "So how\u2019s that sounding", "Ok.  I'm down for working together for mutual benefit.  I'd appreciate it if you began moving your units away from my dots.", "Was planning on it", "Glad I trusted you. I think we\u2019re past the awkward phase of our relationship.", "I hope so, now I need to make sure france is just doing what they did to get into Ven", "Or end around on Germany", "That would be a premature stab", "might be his last real chance.", "how do you want to proceed?  Can you support ION to hold?  I'd like to convoy my army into Apulia.  We can gut Italy like a trout, if that's what you'd like to do.  Otherwise, we could look at getting you back into Warsaw.  Is Germany where you want to head next?", "I kinda have to take care of Italy first so that front is secured", "Ok. Are you ok with the convoy to Apulia?", "Yeah of course", "Or do you want Italy all for yourself! \ud83d\ude0a", "No we could use the help!", "Are you cool with me displacing the last Russian troop so that we don\u2019t have to deal with it", "Also have you reached out to France about your move?", "Let me look at the map.", "And I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea to tell France what my plans are regarding Italy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s interested in sharing the prize.", "I mean, sure. Which unit is going in? I can support it.", "And you can focus on grabbing STP or getting position on Warsaw or Munich.", "Gal is going in", "And France asked me to coordinate so it\u2019s possible that he would want to with you", "Are you coordinating with him? I\u2019d just dislodge Tyrolia - if he retreats into Munich, that\u2019s a win for you. If he takes Venice, we\u2019ll get you in there in the Fall.", "Not really coordinating no", "Ok, cool.  I don't really need to know, and I'll find out in two hours, but I'm wondering if you'll have two units on Venice in the fall - giving us three.", "I\u2019m still not sure", "Ughhh. This is going to be a slog. I guess we\u2019ll be trading centers while Germany and France get bigger. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Well this will be fun", "Unnecessary, though.", "Your call.", "Because it\u2019s highly unlikely France will get to me before Germany comes for you.", "When you wish washed on Venice and suggested collaboration with France, I changed all my orders.", "I only did it because I didn\u2019t trust you, I would have trusted you if you had built that army in Smy", "Ok. You never once said anything to me bout it.", "Didn\u2019t want you to be on to me knowing", "I'm sad, because it feels like I lost a friend.  I really enjoyed talking and strategizing with you.", "We really couldn\u2019t trust each other, we both stabbed on the same turn twice", "what other stab?  Are you referring to Fall '01?  Because I think it's impossible to stab someone in '01.", "Probably what I\u2019m talking about it. How is it impossible? We both went back on an agreement", "1901 is the feeling out year.", "I\u2019d have to look back and see what year I\u2019m thinking of but does it really matter", "Ok, so here's the thing.  One of two things is going to happen. Germany is going to come after you (unlikely) or Germany is going to pour into France (much more likely).", "But, with either scenario, I'm not sure how productive a land war with me is going to be for your long term survival.", "Agreed, I honestly don\u2019t think I can win this game", "well, neither of us is going to solo in 6 years.", "Germany ... could.", "All he needs is Moscow and one of your centers/Marseilles.  Because he has fleet superiority in the north and Italy just took a unit off the board.", "Not probable, but possible.  but it makes sense, he's giving me the hard sell to attack you and offering all sorts of long term assistance.", "Yeah I think he\u2019s gonna solo unless France attacks him", "France can't attack him.", "what is FRance going to attack him with?", "I\u2019m not saying like this season", "I mean, literally, what is he going to attack him with.", "his fleets?", "Wow yeah he does have way too many fleets", "Look, we're not so stuck fighting each other.  I think we both can admit that neither of us is going to \"win\" this game.  But, I'd really prefer not to \"lose\" the game to  a solo.", "So what do you propose", "That we get you into Warsaw.", "I'm being 100% serious.  My orders right now are for a full scale attack on you.  But I'm willing to change them to be cooperative if I feel like you're being honest with me and are actually open to working together.  I also don't \"need\" to get a dot right now and am willing for you to gain - if it's off of Germany.", "I will change SEV to supporting MOS to hold.  UKR will support RUM-GAL, and I suggest you try to get into BOH so that you can cut SIL's support of WAR to hold.", "I could be wrong, and Germany could not go after FRance and instead go after you full bore.  If he does, these are EXACTLY the orders you need to use anyway.  But this prevents the solo by Germany.  Which he could get if you and I fight.  It would be close, but France is totally incompetent and does not have the units to mount an actual defense.  If France had build an Army in Paris, this would be a totally different conversation.  But he built a fleet in Brest.", "You could also take advantage of the situation to re-position your fleet to threaten Venice and take advantage of the French-German situation, but that's your call.  I'd appreciate it if you didn't try to take advantage of this situation and come at me full bore, but - even if you did come at me strong, I'm not sure you gain much.", "And you would risk A LOT by exposing your back to Germany.  Because if you do come after me, you can be damn sure I'm helping him into Moscow and anywhere else I can.", "Yeah I\u2019ll try and come up with the best moves for me, I would be willing to try and work with you because even if you\u2019re lying to me I was gonna lose anyways", "I\u2019m hoping you realize that as well.", "We have time before the next orders are due", "Germany is asking for support into Moscow.", "So, he might be setting up for a move into Galicia. He\u2019s not really being open about his moves.", "Interesting", "So ... what do you want to do?", "Good morning!", "Okay I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t been around, you able to talk?", "What lies were you going to waste my time with on a Sunday evening?", "None, you told me that you currently had an all out attack planned on me until we talked and then we were never able to talk", "I admit that it was kind of my fault we never talked but I couldn\u2019t have faith that you changed your orders since we hadn\u2019t talked", "Go after Warsaw, I\u2019ll build fleets and DMZ our borders. Harass me, and I\u2019ll be a headache for you.", "// I\u2019m disappointed in you.

You chose to ignore them.", "That seems a bit dramatic", "\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I\u2019m interested to see if Germany can solo here.

My recommendation is: \nA: VIE S TYR - BOH\nA: WAR - UKR\nA: STP - MOS\nA: BUD - GAL\nI: TYR - BOH\nI: TRI - TYR\nI: VEN - PIE\nI: TUS S VEN - PIE\nT: SEV - UKR\nT: RUM S WAR - UKR\nT: ANK - SEV (Convoy)\n\nThis plan destroys UKR or ensures that we control it.  It places units in places that they can cut supports on Warsaw which dramatically increases our odds of taking it back if we loose it or maintaining it if we don't.  Chances are, if STP is dislodged, it will be able to retreat to LVN.    Worst case is that Germany just rotates his armies north - supporting himself into LVN and getting three on Warsaw (LVN, PRU, and SIL.  But, we'll either be in Moscow or Galicia (probably both) and Ukraine.  We'll also have two on Munich and he can either keep munich or go after Warsaw.\n\nThe other option is to support ourselves into Galicia and Ukraine.
